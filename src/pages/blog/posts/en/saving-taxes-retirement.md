# How to Save on Your Retirement Taxes

## Retirement Taxes: You Can Save!

Good news: Being retired doesn't mean paying more tax! In fact, with the right strategies, you can often pay less tax than before. There are several tricks you can use to keep more money in your pockets.

## Your Best Friend: The Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA)

### Why TFSA Is Perfect in Retirement

The TFSA is probably the most powerful tool for saving tax when you're retired. Here's why:

**TFSA advantages:**
- Money you withdraw is never taxable
- It doesn't count in calculating your other benefits
- Your investments can continue to grow tax-free
- You can put back withdrawn money the following year

**Your contribution room in 2025:**
- $7,000 for this year
- Plus all your unused room since 2009
- If you've never contributed, you could have over $95,000 in room!

### The RRIF Surplus Strategy

**Here's a trick few people know:**

When you have a RRIF, you must withdraw a minimum amount each year. But if you don't need all that money, here's what you can do:

1. **Withdraw your mandatory minimum from the RRIF**
2. **Use only what you need**
3. **Put the rest in your TFSA**

**Concrete example:**
Jacques is 72 and has $50,000 in his RRIF. He must withdraw at least $2,700 this year. But he only needs $1,500. So he puts $1,200 in his TFSA. This money continues to grow tax-free!

### Investing in Your Family's TFSA

**A little-known strategy:**

If you've used all your TFSA room, you can give money to your spouse or adult children so they contribute to their TFSA.

**The advantages:**
- You have more non-taxable investments in the family
- There are no tax consequences for you
- The money belongs to the person who receives the gift

## Optimize Your RRIF Withdrawals

### Use Your Spouse's Age

**If your spouse is younger than you:**

You can calculate your minimum RRIF withdrawals using your spouse's age instead of yours.

**The savings:**
- Your mandatory withdrawals will be smaller
- More money stays tax-sheltered longer
- You pay less tax each year

**Example:**
- If you're 75: minimum withdrawal of 5.82%
- If your spouse is 70: minimum withdrawal of 5.00%
- On $100,000, that's a difference of $820 per year!

### Plan the Timing of Your Large Withdrawals

**Don't make this common mistake:**

Many people withdraw large amounts from their RRSP or RRIF in a single year. This can push them into a higher tax bracket.

**The best strategy:**
Spread your large withdrawals over two different tax years.

**Example:**
Instead of withdrawing $20,000 in 2025, withdraw $10,000 in December 2025 and $10,000 in January 2026. You could save hundreds of dollars in tax!

## Income Splitting: Divide to Save

### How It Works

Our tax system works in brackets. The more you earn, the more tax you pay. If you can share your income with your spouse, you pay less tax overall.

**Income you can split:**

**Starting at age 65:**
- Your RRIF withdrawals
- Your employer pensions
- Your life annuities

**At any age:**
- Certain disability pensions
- Specific insurance annuities

**How to proceed:**
Fill out form T1032 with your tax returns. You can transfer up to 50% of this income to your spouse.

**Possible savings:**
A couple can save several thousand dollars per year with this strategy!

### Splitting Your QPP Pension

**An often forgotten strategy:**

You and your spouse can ask Retraite Québec to share your QPP pensions.

**Conditions:**
- You must be married or common-law for at least 3 years
- You must both be 60 or older
- At least one of you must receive their QPP pension

**How to do it:**
Contact Retraite Québec and request pension sharing. The calculation takes into account your joint contribution years.

## Avoid Old Age Security Clawback

### The Trap to Avoid

If your income exceeds about $86,912 in 2025, the government will claw back part of your Old Age Security pension. This clawback can go up to 100% of your pension!

### Strategies to Avoid It

**1. Use your TFSA instead of your RRIF**
Money withdrawn from TFSA doesn't count as taxable income.

**2. Split your income with your spouse**
If you transfer 50% of your pension to your spouse, your individual income decreases.

**3. Plan your RRIF withdrawals**
Only withdraw what you need. The surplus goes to your TFSA.

**4. Delay your government pensions**
If you don't need them right away, delay them. They'll increase, but you'll avoid clawback for a few years.

## Maximize Your Special Tax Credits

### Credits You're Entitled To

**Age credit:**
- Available starting at 65
- Can reduce your tax by several hundred dollars
- Decreases if your income is too high

**Pension income credit:**
- Applies to your employer pensions and RRIF (starting at 65)
- Maximum of $2,000 eligible pension income
- Can save you about $600 in tax per year

**Other possible credits:**
- Caregiver credit (if you help a family member)
- Home support credit (for certain services)
- Medical expense credit (more generous for seniors)

### Optimize These Credits

**Important tip:**
If you don't have enough pension income to maximize your credit, consider converting part of your RRSP to RRIF before age 71.

## Smart Investment Strategies

### Choose the Right Types of Income

Different types of income are taxed differently:

**Interest income:** Taxed at 100%
**Canadian dividends:** Favourable tax treatment
**Capital gains:** Only 50% taxable

**The strategy:**
- Keep investments that generate interest in your RRSP/RRIF
- Put dividend-paying stocks in your non-registered accounts
- Use your TFSA for high growth potential investments

### Right Timing for Your Government Pensions

**Old Age Security:**
- You can delay it until age 70
- It increases by 0.6% per month (7.2% per year)
- If you don't need it, wait!

**QPP:**
- Same principle: it increases by 0.7% per month after 65
- It can increase up to 42% if you wait until 70

**The decision:**
Calculate with a financial planner. Sometimes it's better to take pensions right away and invest the money.

## Your Concrete Actions to Save

## The Important Message to Remember

### You Have Control!

In retirement, you have more control over your taxes than before. Unlike when you were working, you can decide:

- How much to withdraw and when
- How to distribute your income with your spouse
- Where to keep your different types of investments
- When to start your government pensions

### Every Dollar Saved Counts

In retirement, your income is often fixed. Every tax dollar saved is one more dollar for:
- Your leisure and travel
- Your financial security
- The inheritance you want to leave
- Your peace of mind

### Start Now

The earlier you start optimizing your retirement taxes, the more you'll save. Even small optimizations, repeated year after year, can save you tens of thousands of dollars over your entire retirement.
