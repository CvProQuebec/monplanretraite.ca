## Interpreting Your Results

### If You Have Too Much Money

**You could:**

- Reduce your current savings

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Forgetting Inflation

**The problem:** $1,000 today will only be worth $750 in 10 years with 3% inflation.
**The solution:** Most calculators include inflation automatically.

### Mistake 2: Being Too Optimistic

**The problem:** Overestimating your income or underestimating your expenses.
**The solution:** Be conservative in your estimates.

### Mistake 3: Only Calculating Once

**The problem:** Your situation changes over time.
**The solution:** Redo the calculation each year or when your situation changes.

### Mistake 4: Ignoring Taxes

**The problem:** Forgetting that RRSP and RRIF withdrawals are taxable.
**The solution:** Good calculators account for taxes.

### Mistake 5: Not Planning a Margin

**The problem:** Calculating just what you need without a safety margin.
**The solution:** Add 10% to 20% more than what the calculator suggests.

## When to Consult a Professional

### Calculators Are Sufficient If:
- Your situation is simple
- You just want a general estimate
- You're starting your planning

### Consult an Advisor If:
- You have multiple complex income sources
- You want to optimize your taxes

- You have special needs (illness, inheritance, etc.)

## Tips to Maximize Calculator Usefulness

**Create a folder** with:
- Results from each calculator

**Compare year to year** to see your progress.

### Test Extreme Scenarios

**What happens if:**
- You lose your job 5 years before retirement?
- Inflation rises to 5%?

### Use Results to Take Action
