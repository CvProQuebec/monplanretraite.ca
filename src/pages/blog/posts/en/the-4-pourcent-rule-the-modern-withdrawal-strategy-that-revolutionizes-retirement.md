# The 4% Rule: The Modern Withdrawal Strategy That Revolutionizes Retirement

*Published September 18, 2025 | Reading time: 10 minutes*

**For 30 years, a simple rule has guided retirees around the world: withdraw 4% of your savings the first year, then adjust for inflation. This strategy has survived every financial crisis since 1928. Discover how to apply it to secure your retirement.**

## üéØ **What Is the 4% Rule?**

The 4% rule is a withdrawal strategy that answers the crucial question every retiree asks: **‚ÄúHow much can I withdraw each year without running out of money?‚Äù**

### **The principle in 3 simple steps**

1. **First year of retirement**: Withdraw 4% of your total savings
2. **Following years**: Increase that amount by 3% per year (inflation adjustment)
3. **Result**: Your savings last 30+ years in 80‚Äì90% of historical scenarios

### **Concrete example: Mathieu, 65 years old**

* **Retirement capital**: \$750,000
* **Year 1 withdrawal**: \$30,000 (4% of \$750,000)
* **Year 2 withdrawal**: \$30,900 (\$30,000 + 3% inflation)
* **Year 3 withdrawal**: \$31,827 (\$30,900 + 3% inflation)

**And so on for 30 years‚Äîregardless of market fluctuations!**

## üìö **The Fascinating History Behind the Rule**

### **1994: William Bengen Revolutionizes Retirement**

In 1994, U.S. financial planner **William Bengen** asked a revolutionary question: *‚ÄúWhat is the maximum withdrawal rate a retiree can use without running out of money in 30 years?‚Äù*

He analyzed **all possible retirements from 1926 to 1976** with a 50/50 U.S. stocks/bonds portfolio.

**His shocking discovery**: 4% was the maximum rate that worked in **100% of cases**, even for those retiring during the Great Depression of 1929!

### **1998: The Trinity Study Confirms**

Trinity University validated the results with even more data. The 4% rule became **the global retirement standard**.

### **2024‚Äì2025: Modern Update**

Experts revisited the rule with 30 more years of data, including:

* 2000‚Äì2002 dot-com crash
* 2008 global financial crisis
* COVID-19 pandemic (2020‚Äì2022)

**Verdict**: The rule still holds! Even strengthened with modern tools.

## üî¨ **The Science Behind the Rule: Why It Works**

### **Ultimate Test: Every Worst-Case Scenario Since 1928**

Imagine retiring at the **worst possible moment**:

| **Retirement Year** | **Major Crisis**  | **Result with 4% Rule** |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| **1929**            | Great Depression  | ‚úÖ Survived 30 years     |
| **1937**            | Severe recession  | ‚úÖ Survived 30 years     |
| **1973**            | Oil crisis (-44%) | ‚úÖ Survived 30 years     |
| **2000**            | Dot-com crash     | ‚úÖ Survived 30 years     |
| **2008**            | Financial crisis  | ‚úÖ Survived 30 years     |

**Stunning conclusion**: Even when retiring at the **worst point in history**, the 4% rule worked in 85‚Äì90% of cases!

### **The Secret: The Magic Balance**

The rule works because it balances perfectly:

**üîº Growth**: Stocks beat inflation and create wealth
**üõ°Ô∏è Protection**: Bonds provide stability and income
**‚è∞ Time**: 30 years allow you to ride out multiple market cycles

## ‚ö° **2025 Version: Modern Improvements**

### **Improvement #1: Optimized Allocation**

**Old version (Bengen 1994)**: 50% U.S. stocks / 50% U.S. bonds
**Modern 2025 version**: Advanced global diversification

| **Asset Class**          | **% Recommended** | **Reasoning**                          |
| ------------------------ | ----------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Canadian stocks**      | 20‚Äì25%            | Familiarity, dividends, local currency |
| **U.S. stocks**          | 30‚Äì35%            | Largest market, innovation             |
| **International stocks** | 15‚Äì20%            | Diversification, economic cycles       |
| **Mixed bonds**          | 25‚Äì35%            | Stability, income, protection          |

### **Improvement #2: Age-Based Adjustment**

* **65‚Äì75 years**: 4.0% (25+ year horizon)
* **75‚Äì85 years**: 4.2% (15+ year horizon)
* **85+ years**: 4.5% (10+ year horizon)

### **Improvement #3: Tactical Flexibility**

* **Bull markets**: Withdraw a bit less to build a cushion
* **Bear markets**: Use your cushion to maintain lifestyle

## üí∞ **Detailed Case Study: Lucie and Pierre, Age 62**

### **Starting situation**

* **Combined capital**: \$1,200,000
* **Annual needs**: \$50,000 today
* **Goal**: Retire at 65, protect 30 years

### **Applying the 4% Rule**

* **Year 1 (age 65)**: \$1,200,000 √ó 4% = **\$48,000**
* **Year 2 (age 66)**: \$48,000 √ó 1.03 = **\$49,440**
* **Year 5 (age 70)**: ‚âà **\$54,000**
* **Year 15 (age 80)**: ‚âà **\$72,500**
* **Year 25 (age 90)**: ‚âà **\$97,500**

### **Simulated market scenarios**

**Scenario A ‚Äì Average market (6% return)**

* **Capital after 30 years**: \$1,400,000
* **Potential inheritance**: Substantial

**Scenario B ‚Äì Difficult market (4% return)**

* **Capital after 30 years**: \$200,000
* **Mission accomplished**: 30 years secured

**Scenario C ‚Äì Major crisis in year 1**

* **Initial drop**: ‚Äì30% (capital to \$840,000)
* **Result**: Survival ensured through diversification

## üõ†Ô∏è **How to Implement the Rule: Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Calculate Your Retirement Capital**

Add up all your savings:

* RRSPs and RRIFs
* TFSAs
* Non-registered savings
* Employer plans (transfer value)

**Exception**: Do NOT include your primary residence (not liquid).

### **Step 2: Define Your Net Needs**

Calculate annual expenses **minus**:

* CPP/QPP benefits
* Old Age Security
* Other guaranteed income

**Example**:

* Total expenses: \$65,000
* CPP/OAS: \$18,000
* **Net needs**: \$47,000

### **Step 3: Check Feasibility**

**Required capital** = Net needs √∑ 4%

In our example: \$47,000 √∑ 0.04 = **\$1,175,000**

If you have \$1,175,000 or more ‚Üí ‚úÖ Rule applies
If less ‚Üí Adjustments needed

### **Step 4: Optimize Your Allocation**

Distribute according to the modern model:

* **Stocks (60‚Äì70%)**: Globally diversified
* **Bonds (30‚Äì40%)**: Government and corporate
* **Cash (5‚Äì10%)**: Emergency fund (1‚Äì2 years expenses)

### **Step 5: Automate the System**

* **Monthly withdrawals**: Divide annual amount by 12
* **Annual adjustments**: Review every January
* **Rebalancing**: Once per year to maintain targets

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Pitfalls to Avoid and Practical Solutions**

### **Pitfall #1: Sequence Risk**

**Problem**: A big market drop in your first years of retirement

**Modern solution**: Cash ladder

* Keep **2 years of withdrawals** in short-term bonds/cash
* Never sell stocks in a major downturn
* Live off your cash until recovery

### **Pitfall #2: Rising Healthcare Costs**

**Reality**: Healthcare costs rise faster than general inflation

**Solution**: Progressive inflation adjustment

* **65‚Äì75 years**: Normal inflation (3%)
* **75‚Äì85 years**: Inflation +1% (4%)
* **85+ years**: Inflation +2% (5%)

### **Pitfall #3: Psychological Rigidity**

**Problem**: Sticking blindly to 4% even if circumstances change

**Solution**: Smart annual review

* **Exceptional market**: Lower to 3.5% and build a cushion
* **Prolonged downturn**: Temporarily cut non-essential spending
* **Health changes**: Adjust to new needs

## üåç **Canadian Adaptation: Local Specifics**

### **Key Differences vs. U.S.**

**More generous government benefits**

* CPP/QPP: Up to \$1,300/month
* OAS + GIS: Up to \$1,100/month combined
* **Impact**: Reduces private capital needed

**Different taxation**

* Pension income splitting at 65
* Age tax credit
* **Strategy**: Optimize withdrawal order (RRIF before TFSA)

**Canadian longevity**

* Life expectancy higher than in U.S.
* **Adjustment**: Plan for 32‚Äì35 years vs. 30 years

### **Adapted Formula for Quebec**

**Required capital** = (Annual expenses ‚Äì CPP/QPP ‚Äì OAS ‚Äì Other income) √∑ 3.8%

*Note: 3.8% instead of 4% to account for longer longevity.*

## ‚ùì **Frequently Asked Questions from Retirees**

### **Q: What if my portfolio loses 30% in year one?**

**A:** That‚Äôs exactly the scenario tested since 1928! Keep following the rule but draw from your cash cushion (2 years) instead of selling stocks at the wrong time. Historically, recovery takes 2‚Äì4 years.

### **Q: Can I increase my withdrawal rate if I need less?**

**A:** The beauty of the rule: if you withdraw less than 4%, you create a cushion for later. Many retirees start at 3.5% in good years for more flexibility later.

### **Q: Does the rule still work with today‚Äôs interest rates?**

**A:** Yes. Low rates from the 2010s were already included in historical tests. The rule accounts for all environments: high rates (1980s), low rates (2010s), high inflation (1970s).

### **Q: What if I live more than 30 years in retirement?**

**A:** Great question! In 60% of historical scenarios, your capital actually **grows** during retirement thanks to stock growth. You may end up with more money after 30 years than at the start!

### **Q: Should I adjust based on market performance?**

**A:** The original rule says no‚Äîthat‚Äôs its psychological strength. But a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù version allows small tweaks: ‚Äì0.5% in bad years, +0.5% in great years, always between 3‚Äì5%.
