# Retirement Budget: What Really Changes

*Published September 18, 2025*

Planning your retirement budget doesn’t have to be a source of anxiety. Contrary to popular belief, creating a realistic budget for your golden years can be simple and reassuring. Here’s what really changes in your budget when you retire in Quebec.

## The Rules of the Game Completely Change

In retirement, your relationship with money transforms profoundly. More than 30% of Quebecers avoid talking about their finances—but this is exactly when these discussions become crucial for your future peace of mind.

**The good news?** Your financial needs naturally decrease in several budget categories. Gone are expensive office clothes, daily business lunches, and commuting costs. These automatic savings often represent 20 to 30% of your current budget.

## Forget the 70% Myth

For decades, experts have repeated that you need 70% of your gross salary to maintain your lifestyle in retirement. This rule of thumb deserves nuance depending on your personal situation.

Nasser Mama, financial planner and group savings advisor at FlexiFonds, proposes a more realistic approach: *“You can plan for a budget equal to 50% of your salary. Unless you are a big spender, it’s possible to live well without necessarily reaching the 70% ratio.”*

**Your ideal percentage depends on:**

* Your average salary in recent years
* Your retirement projects (travel, hobbies, renovations)
* Your expected health condition
* Your personal definition of quality of life
* The possibility of part-time work

## Your New Budget Categories

In retirement, some expenses disappear while others appear or increase.

### What decreases or disappears:

* Professional clothing
* Commuting costs
* Lunches at restaurants
* RRSP contributions (replaced by RRIF withdrawals)
* Expensive wardrobe items

### What increases:

* Healthcare and medication costs
* Leisure and activities
* Travel and outings
* Energy costs (more time at home)
* Supplemental insurance

## Government Income: Your Safety Net

In Quebec, three government programs form the foundation of your retirement income:

**Old Age Security (OAS)**
Available at 65 for those who have lived at least 10 years in Canada after age 18.

**Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**
Based on your lifetime contributions during your working years.

**Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)**
For retirees with modest incomes.

**Important:** These three sources generally aren’t enough to maintain the standard of living of an average-income worker. They represent about 40% of the required income.

## The 6-Step Method to Build Your Retirement Budget

### Step 1: Brainstorming Session (15 minutes)

List all your current and future expenses on a blank sheet. Review your bank and credit card statements to identify periodic expenses.

### Step 2: Categorize Expenses (20 minutes)

Use detailed grids to classify expenses into categories: housing, food, healthcare, leisure, transportation.

### Step 3: Put Numbers on Everything (30 minutes)

Assign a realistic monthly amount to each category. Don’t forget to include annual expenses (insurance, property taxes) spread over 12 months.

### Step 4: Make Strategic Choices (1 hour)

This crucial step is where you decide to reduce some expenses in order to prioritize others. Consider debt repayment and your real priorities.

### Step 5: Take Action (for life!)

Regularly compare actual expenses with your projected budget. This discipline helps you spend thoughtfully.

### Step 6: Consult a Professional

A financial planner can help you optimize your strategy: level payments, debt consolidation, choosing between TFSA and RRSP.

## Special Challenges of the Retirement Budget

### Inflation, Your Silent Enemy

With an annual inflation rate of 3%, the cost of your grocery basket doubles in 24 years. Your budget must account for this reality to preserve your purchasing power.

### Increasing Longevity

A healthy 65-year-old retired couple has a strong chance that one of them will live past age 90. Your budget must potentially cover 30 years of retirement or more.

### Healthcare Costs

These generally increase with age. Planning a realistic healthcare budget is essential, as assistive technologies and specialized care represent significant expenses.

## Concrete Solutions if Your Budget Falls Short

If you realize late that your savings are insufficient, several options are available:

**Part-Time Work**
More retirees choose this option to boost their income while maintaining social ties and sharing expertise.

**Lifestyle Simplification**
Downsize from the family home to a condo, sell the second car, or move to a less expensive region.

**Tax Optimization**
A financial planner can help you structure withdrawals to minimize your tax burden.

---

## Your Retirement Budget in Practice

To build your personalized budget, start by calculating your guaranteed income (QPP, OAS, possibly GIS), then determine the amount you need to draw from your private savings (RRSP, RRIF, TFSA, investments).

**Concrete example:**

* Government income: \$1,800 per month
* Budget needs: \$3,500 per month
* Shortfall: \$1,700 per month

This \$1,700 gap must come from your personal savings, or about \$20,400 per year.

## The Art of Aging Financially Well

A successful retirement budget also means accepting that your priorities will evolve. What seemed essential at 45 may feel unnecessary at 70. Your budget should reflect these changes in values and adapt to your reality.

The secret? Start early, review regularly, and don’t hesitate to seek professional help. Your retirement deserves planning that matches your dreams.

*A well-planned budget is your best passport to a serene retirement. Don’t wait to complete this essential exercise: your future self will thank you.*
