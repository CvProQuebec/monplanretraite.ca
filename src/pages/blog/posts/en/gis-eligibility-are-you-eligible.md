# Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS): Are You Eligible?

The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) is extra, tax‑free money for low‑income seniors in Canada. If your income is modest, you should check your eligibility — many people are surprised to find out they qualify.

This guide explains the basics, who can get it, how much you could receive, and how to avoid losing it.

## What is GIS?

- GIS is an additional monthly amount paid to seniors with low income.
- It’s added on top of your Old Age Security (OAS).
- It is tax‑free.
- The amount depends on your annual income and marital situation.

You must already receive OAS to get GIS.

## Who is eligible?

You can qualify if:
- You receive OAS, and
- Your annual income (not counting OAS) is below the government thresholds.

Income considered includes things like CPP/QPP, RRSP/RRIF withdrawals, pensions, investment income, and employment income. TFSA withdrawals do not count as income.

## Income thresholds (typical order of magnitude)

Amounts change each year and depend on your situation. As a simple guide (rounded, for reference only):
- Single senior: under about $22,000 (excluding OAS)
- Couple: under about $29,000 (combined, excluding OAS)

These are ballpark figures and change with updates. Always check the current tables on the Government of Canada website.

## How much can you receive?

- The lower your income, the higher your GIS.
- Maximum amounts are adjusted 4 times per year for inflation.
- GIS is paid monthly and recalculated each year based on your tax return.

Because GIS is tax‑free, every dollar you receive is a net dollar in your pocket.

## Common situations

1) Single with small CPP/QPP and no RRSP/RRIF  
- Likely to qualify for a meaningful GIS amount.

2) Couple with modest CPP/QPP and small pensions  
- May qualify as a couple — your combined income matters.

3) Have RRSPs or RRIF withdrawals  
- RRIF withdrawals count as income and can reduce or eliminate GIS. Plan carefully.

4) TFSA savings  
- Withdrawals from a TFSA do not count as income. Using TFSA for extra expenses can help you keep GIS.

## How GIS is reduced (the “clawback”)

As your income rises, GIS decreases progressively until it reaches zero. This is separate from OAS recovery. The key idea: keeping taxable income low helps preserve GIS.

## Strategies to help you qualify or keep more GIS

- Prefer TFSA withdrawals for extra spending (does not count as income).
- Be careful with RRIF withdrawals — only withdraw the minimum if you need GIS.
- Spread capital gains over multiple years to avoid a big “income” year.
- Coordinate CPP/QPP start age: sometimes delaying can reduce taxable income early.
- If you’re close to the thresholds, run the numbers — a small change can make a big difference.

## Allowance and Allowance for the Survivor (ages 60–64)

If you’re 60–64 and your spouse/partner receives OAS and has low income, you might qualify for the Allowance. If you’re widowed and 60–64, you might qualify for the Allowance for the Survivor. These amounts are also income‑tested and can be significant.

## How to apply

- If you already receive OAS, GIS can be automatic based on your tax return — but do not assume it.  
- You can apply online through Service Canada or by mail.  
- Have your documents ready and ensure you file your tax return on time each year, even with low income.

## Quick checklist

- Do I receive OAS?  
- What’s my (or our) annual income excluding OAS?  
- Can I reduce taxable withdrawals (RRIF) and use TFSA instead?  
- Did I file my tax return on time?

## Bottom line

GIS is designed to protect seniors with low income. It is tax‑free and can be worth hundreds of dollars per month. If your income is modest, check your eligibility — and plan your withdrawals to avoid losing this benefit.
