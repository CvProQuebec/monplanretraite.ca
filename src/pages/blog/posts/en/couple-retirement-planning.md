# Planning Retirement as a Couple: Avoiding Surprises

Planning retirement as a couple is like preparing for a long journey together: you need to talk, make plans together, and avoid unpleasant surprises. Unfortunately, too many couples discover too late that they didn't have the same vision of their retirement. Here's how to prepare well together.

## Why Planning Together is So Important

### Financial Stress Can Break Couples

**Did you know that 31% of Quebecers feel stressed when they think about money?** This stress causes:
- Anxiety (42%)
- **Couple arguments (29%)**
- Insomnia (26%)

**In retirement, this stress can be even worse** because your income decreases and you spend more time together.

### You May Not Have the Same Life Expectancy

**Here's an important fact:** In a couple of 65-year-olds in good health, there's a very strong chance that one of them will live to 90. **This means one of you will probably live several years alone.**

**Why this matters:**
- The one who lives longer will need money for a longer period
- Expenses don't always drop by half when you become widowed
- You need to plan for 30 years of retirement, not just 15 or 20

## Main Surprises to Avoid

### 1. Not Talking About Money

**The problem:** More than 30% of Quebecers don't like talking about money, even with their spouse.

**The consequences:**
- Each has different expectations
- You discover too late that you haven't saved enough
- You don't take advantage of strategies to save on taxes

**The solution:** Plan your retirement budget together, as a team.

### 2. Having Very Different Incomes

**The common problem:** One spouse has contributed the maximum to their RRSP for 30 years, the other has saved little.

**Concrete example:**
- **Spouse A:** $80,000 in their RRSPs
- **Spouse B:** $15,000 in their RRSPs
- **Result:** In retirement, A will have $4,000 per month, B will have $800

**Why this is a problem:**
- The one with less money will feel dependent
- You'll pay much more taxes
- Your government benefits might be reduced

### 3. Not Using Income Splitting

**What it is:** Transferring part of your retirement income to your spouse to pay less taxes.

**Simple example:**
- **Without splitting:** One spouse has $40,000 income, the other has $10,000
- **With splitting:** Each has $25,000 income
- **Result:** You pay much less taxes!

**Why it works:** Our tax system is progressive. Two average incomes cost less than one big income and one small one.

### 4. Forgetting Quebec Pension Plan Division

**A little-known strategy:** You can divide your Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) benefits between you.

**The conditions:**
- You must both be 60 or older
- You must both receive your QPP pension
- You must be married, in a civil union, or common-law for 3 years

**The tax advantage:** If one spouse receives $1,433 per month from QPP and the other nothing, splitting could save you up to $4,583 per year in taxes!

### 5. Not Planning for Healthcare Costs

**Reality:** Healthcare costs increase with age, especially after 75.

**The statistics:**
- **A 65-year-old woman** will be dependent for about 6 years before dying
- **A 65-year-old man** will be dependent for about 3 years
- **39% of people** wouldn't be able to afford a prolonged illness

**Important:** Only half of employers continue to offer health insurance to retirees.

## How to Plan Well Together

### Step 1: Have "the conversation"

**Sit down together and talk about:**

**Your retirement dreams:**
- At what age do you want to retire?
- Do you want to travel? Move? Renovate?
- Do you have expensive projects?

**Your current financial situation:**
- How much do you each have in your RRSPs?
- Do you have workplace pension funds?
- How much do you spend per month now?

**Your concerns:**
- Are you afraid of running out of money?
- Are you worried about your health?
- What will you do if one of you dies first?

### Step 2: Create a Complete Picture

**List ALL your future income:**
- Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) benefits
- Old Age Security pension
- Your employers' pension funds
- RRSPs and RRIFs
- TFSAs
- Other investments
- Rental income (if you have any)

**Calculate your retirement expenses:**
- Housing (paid mortgage or rent)
- Food and basic expenses
- Transportation (maybe one car)
- Leisure and travel
- Supplementary healthcare

### Step 3: Create a Budget Together

**The general rule:** You'll need about 70% of your current income to maintain your standard of living.

**But beware:** This rule doesn't apply to everyone. Some need less (50-60%), others need more (80-90%).

**Factors that reduce your needs:**
- No more mortgage to pay
- No more work expenses (clothes, transportation, meals)
- No more RRSP contributions

**Factors that increase your needs:**
- More time for expensive leisure activities
- Private healthcare
- Travel and retirement activities

### Step 4: Use Tax Strategies for Couples

#### Pension Income Splitting (very important!)

**From age 65:** You can transfer up to 50% of your eligible pension income to your spouse.

**Eligible income:**
- RRIFs
- Pension fund annuities
- Life annuities

**Tip:** This strategy only works if there's an income difference between you. If you both have similar incomes, it doesn't help.

#### Spousal RRSP Contributions

**While you're still working:** The spouse who earns more can contribute to the other's RRSP.

**Advantage:** This balances your retirement income in advance.

**Caution:** If you separate, this strategy becomes less advantageous for married couples (due to family patrimony).

#### Other Strategies

**The wealthier spouse can:**
- Pay all the couple's expenses (to allow the other to save)
- Make a gift to allow the spouse to contribute to their TFSA
- Lend money at the prescribed rate for the other to invest

### Step 5: Plan for Different Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: You Both Retire at the Same Time

**Questions to consider:**
- Will you have enough money for two?
- How will you spend all this time together?
- What will be the impact on your taxes?

#### Scenario 2: You Retire at Different Times

**Questions to consider:**
- How will you manage the transition?
- Will the one still working pay more taxes?
- Will you have the same leisure activities?

#### Scenario 3: One of You Becomes Widowed

**Difficult but important questions:**
- Will the survivor have enough money?
- Who will take care of the finances?
- Are there sufficient life insurance policies?

**Tip:** Both spouses should understand family finances, not just one.

## Specific Strategies by Situation

### If One Spouse Has Never Worked or Worked Little

**Challenges:**
- Very few RRSPs
- No pension fund
- Minimum QPP

**Solutions:**
- Maximize RRSP contributions of the working spouse in the other's name
- Use TFSAs to the maximum
- Plan that the spouse without income will receive more government assistance (Guaranteed Income Supplement)

### If You Have Very Different Ages

**Challenges:**
- The younger one may not be able to split income before 65
- Differences in healthcare needs
- More complex estate planning

**Solutions:**
- Use the younger spouse's age to calculate RRIF minimum withdrawals
- Maximize TFSAs (no age restrictions)
- Consider life insurance

### If You're in a Common-Law Relationship

**Caution:** The rules are different!
- No automatic family patrimony
- RRSP splitting becomes a gift
- More risks in case of separation

**Tips:**
- Consider a cohabitation agreement
- Favor pension income splitting (less risky)
- Make sure each has savings in their own name

## Most Common Couple Mistakes

### 1. Waiting Until 64 to Start Planning

**Why it's a mistake:** There's not enough time left to fix problems or use certain strategies.

**Tip:** Start planning seriously around age 50. There will still be time to make adjustments.

### 2. Assuming the Other Takes Care of Everything

**The problem:** Often, one spouse handles finances and the other knows nothing.

**Why it's dangerous:** If the "responsible" spouse dies first, the other is left lost.

**Solution:** Both spouses should understand:
- How much money you have and where
- What your retirement income is
- How your investments work
- Who your advisors are

### 3. Not Reviewing the Plan Regularly

**Why review:** Your situations change:
- Salaries that increase
- Inheritances
- Health problems
- Changes in laws

**Tip:** Review your retirement plan together every year.

### 4. Forgetting About Inflation

**The danger:** What costs $1,000 today will cost $1,800 in 20 years with 3% inflation.

**Solution:** Your investments must grow faster than inflation, even in retirement.

### 5. Not Having an Emergency Fund

**Why it's important in retirement:**
- Expensive home repairs
- Unexpected health problems
- Financial help for adult children

**Tip:** Keep the equivalent of 6 months to 1 year of expenses in easily accessible money (TFSA, savings account).
