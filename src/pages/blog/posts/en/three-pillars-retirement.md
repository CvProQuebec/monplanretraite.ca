# The Three Pillars of Your Retirement - QPP/CPP, Employer Plans and Personal Savings Explained Simply

Planning your retirement is like building a solid house. You need three strong pillars to support your financial comfort. Here's how these three pillars work together to ensure you have a peaceful retirement.

## Why Three Pillars?

When you work, your salary comes from one source: your employer. In retirement, it's different. Your money must come from several places to replace your salary.

To live well in retirement, you need about 60% to 80% of your current salary. The three pillars help you reach this goal.

## First Pillar: Government Programs (QPP/CPP and Old Age Security)

### What it is

The first pillar is the money that governments give you when you retire. These programs provide you with about 30% to 40% of your former salary.

### Old Age Security (OAS)

**For whom**: All Canadians aged 65 and over.

**The conditions**:
- Have lived in Canada at least 10 years since age 18
- Have legal Canadian status
- No need to have worked

**How much you receive**:
- Maximum: $734.95 per month (ages 65 to 74)
- Maximum: $808.45 per month (75 years and over)
- The amount depends on the number of years you've lived in Canada

**Important to know**:
- This pension is taxable
- If you earn more than $90,997 per year, you'll have to repay part of it
- You can delay this pension up to 5 years to get more money

### Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

**For whom**: People who receive OAS and have low income.

**How much**: Up to $1,097.75 per month for a single person.

**Advantage**: This benefit is not taxable.

### Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) or Canada Pension Plan (CPP)

**For whom**: Workers who contributed while they worked.

**Important rules**:
- You can start receiving your pension at 60, but it will be reduced
- At 65, you receive 100% of your pension
- If you wait past 65, your pension increases

**Simple calculations**:
- **Before 65**: Your pension decreases by 0.5% to 0.6% per month
- **After 65**: Your pension increases by 0.7% per month (until 72)

**Practical example**:
- If you take your pension at 60: 36% less than at 65
- If you wait until 70: 42% more than at 65

**How to know your rights**:
- Request your statement on the Retraite Québec website
- Check for errors
- Bring this statement to your financial planner

## Second Pillar: Your Employer's Retirement Plans

### What it is

Many employers offer a retirement plan to their employees. It's a bonus that adds to government programs.

### The Two Main Types

**1. Defined Benefit Plan**
- **How it works**: You receive a fixed amount each month for the rest of your life
- **The calculation**: Based on your salary and years of service
- **The advantage**: You know exactly how much you'll receive
- **Who pays**: Your employer takes care of everything

**2. Defined Contribution Plan**
- **How it works**: You and your employer put money into an account in your name
- **The calculation**: Depends on how much you've saved and the return on your investments
- **The responsibility**: You choose your investments
- **The risk**: The final amount can vary according to markets

### How to Know What You Have

**Check with your employer**:
- Call the human resources department
- Ask for your retirement plan statements
- Keep all these documents in a file

**Important questions to ask**:
- What type of plan do you have?
- How much have you accumulated?
- At what age can you retire?
- What happens if you change jobs?

### Locked-in Accounts

If you change jobs, your retirement money can be transferred to a locked-in account. This money is "locked" until your retirement to ensure you use it for your retirement.

## Third Pillar: Your Personal Savings

### What it is

This is the money you save yourself for your retirement. This pillar is often the most important for having a comfortable retirement.

### RRSPs (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)

**How it works**:
- You put money in an RRSP
- You pay less taxes now
- Your money grows without being taxed
- You only pay taxes when you withdraw the money

**The transformation to RRIF**:
- At 71, you must transform your RRSP into a RRIF
- The RRIF gives you regular income in retirement
- You must withdraw a minimum amount each year

### TFSAs (Tax-Free Savings Account)

**The advantages**:
- You never pay taxes on gains
- You can withdraw your money anytime
- No mandatory minimum withdrawal

### Other Ways to Save

**Your personal investments**:
- Guaranteed investment certificates (GICs)
- Mutual funds
- Stocks and bonds
- Revenue properties

**Other assets to consider**:
- The value of your house
- Your life insurance
- Your participation in a business

## How the Three Pillars Work Together

### A Concrete Example

**Mr. Tremblay, 65, salary of $50,000 per year**:

**First pillar (governments)**:
- Old Age Security: $734.95 per month
- QPP: about $800 per month
- **Total**: $1,534.95 per month (about $18,400 per year)

**Second pillar (employer)**:
- Employer retirement plan: $600 per month
- **Total**: $7,200 per year

**Third pillar (personal savings)**:
- RRIF: $800 per month
- **Total**: $9,600 per year

**Total retirement income**: $35,200 per year (70% of his former salary)

### Why All Pillars are Important

**If a pillar is missing**:
- Without employer plan: You must save much more yourself
- Without personal savings: Difficult to have the desired standard of living
- Without government programs: Impossible for most people

## Security Levels of Each Pillar

### Very Safe Sources (paid for life)
- Old Age Security (OAS)
- QPP/CPP
- Defined benefit plans

These sources are like regular salary. They don't change according to financial markets.

### Less Predictable Sources
- Defined contribution plans
- RRIFs
- Personal savings

These sources can vary according to:
- The type of investments chosen
- Market performance
- The timing and amount of withdrawals

## Practical Tips for Building Your Three Pillars

### Start Early

**In your twenties and thirties**:
- Maximize your contributions to your employer's plan
- Start an RRSP even with small amounts
- Contribute to TFSA if possible

**In your forties**:
- Increase your RRSP contributions
- Check your QPP rights each year
- Plan your retirement strategy

**In your fifties**:
- Catch up on your RRSP contributions if necessary
- Meet with a financial planner
- Prepare your transition to retirement

### Use All Available Tools

**To maximize the first pillar**:
- Check your QPP/CPP statements regularly
- Plan the right time to apply for your benefits
- Consider delaying OAS if you have other income

**To optimize the second pillar**:
- Participate maximally in your employer's plan
- Understand your plan well
- Plan transfers if you change jobs

**To develop the third pillar**:
- Automate your RRSP contributions
- Diversify your investments
- Use unused contribution rights

## Advanced Strategies

### Income Splitting

In retirement, you can share certain income with your spouse to pay less taxes. This works with:
- RRIF income
- Employer plan annuities
- Certain other retirement income sources

### Tax Planning

**Before retirement**:
- Balance RRSP and TFSA according to your situation
- Plan your withdrawals to minimize taxes
- Consider your spouse's age for RRIFs

**In retirement**:
- Manage your withdrawals to avoid losing OAS
- Use TFSA for RRIF surpluses
- Plan the order of your withdrawals

## When to Ask for Help

### Meet with a financial planner if

- Your situation is complex
- You have several sources of income
- You want to optimize your taxes
- You're approaching retirement

### Questions to Ask a Professional

- Have I saved enough for my retirement?
- What's the best time to take my benefits?
- How to minimize my taxes?
- How to coordinate my three pillars?

## In Summary

**The three pillars of your retirement**:

1. **Governments (QPP/CPP + OAS)**: The solid foundation, about 30-40% of your needs
