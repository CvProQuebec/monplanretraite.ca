# Widowhood: Managing Your Finances After Your Spouse's Death

## A Trial Where You Must Also Think About Money

Losing your spouse is one of life's most difficult trials. In addition to immense grief, you must face numerous administrative and financial procedures. It's normal to feel overwhelmed.

This article guides you step by step through the financial aspects of widowhood. It will help you understand your rights, the benefits you're entitled to, and how to reorganize your finances for your new situation.

Take your time. There's no urgency to settle everything immediately. The important thing is to move forward at your own pace.

## Your Rights: What You're Automatically Entitled To

### The QPP Death Benefit

If your spouse contributed to the Quebec Pension Plan, you're entitled to a death benefit of $2,500.

**How it works:**
- This amount is paid as a priority to the person who paid the funeral expenses
- If expenses cost less than $2,500, the difference goes to the estate
- You have 60 days to apply after the death

**Important:** This sum is taxable and must be declared in the estate's tax return.

### The Surviving Spouse's Pension

This is a monthly pension you'll receive for life if your spouse contributed sufficiently to the QPP. The amount depends on several factors.

**Who is entitled to this pension:**
- Married spouses not legally separated
- Civil union spouses
- Common-law spouses who lived together for at least 3 years (or 1 year with a child)

**2025 amounts (maximum possible):**

| Your age | Your situation | Amount per month |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Under 45 | No dependent child | $689.43 |
| Under 45 | With dependent child(ren) | $1,091.84 |
| Under 45 | Disabled | $1,134.61 |
| 45 to 64 | All situations | $1,134.61 |
| 65 and over | Without other retirement pension | $844.24 |

**Important points:**
- This pension is paid for life
- It increases each year with inflation
- You don't lose it if you remarry
- It's taxable as income

### The Orphan's Pension

If you have minor children from your deceased spouse, you'll receive $301.77 per month per child until they turn 18.

### The Allowance for the Survivor (60 to 64 years)

If you're between 60 and 64 years old and your income is low, you could receive a special allowance from the federal government. This assistance is in addition to other benefits.

## Your Spouse's Savings: What You're Entitled To

### Your Spouse's RRSPs

If you were the surviving spouse, your deceased partner's RRSPs can be transferred to you without immediate tax.

**Your options:**
1. **Transfer to your own RRSP:** If you're 71 or younger, you can transfer the money to your RRSP
2. **Transfer to your RRIF:** If you already have a RRIF, you can transfer the funds there
3. **Purchase an annuity:** You can use the money to buy a life annuity

**Important:** You have until 60 days after the end of the year to make the transfer. Otherwise, you'll have to pay tax on the entire amount.

### Your Spouse's RRIFs

If your spouse had a RRIF, you can become the "successor annuitant." This means the RRIF continues as if it were yours.

**Advantages:**
- No tax to pay immediately
- Minimum withdrawals are based on your age
- You keep control of investments

### Employer Retirement Plans

If your spouse had a retirement plan with their employer, check if there are death benefits.

**Possibilities:**
- **Reversible pension:** Part of your spouse's pension continues to be paid to you
- **Death benefits:** A lump sum according to the plan
- **Contribution refund:** If your spouse wasn't yet retired

**Important:** Contact the employer or plan administrator quickly to know your rights.

## Insurance: Check All Policies

### Life Insurance

If your spouse had life insurance, you could receive a significant amount.

**Types of insurance to check:**
- **Personal life insurance:** Individual policy
- **Group life insurance:** Through employer
- **Mortgage insurance:** That pays the mortgage
- **Credit insurance:** On credit cards or loans

**Steps:**
1. Find all insurance policies
2. Contact each insurance company
3. Provide the death certificate
4. Complete claim forms

### Other Possible Compensations

Depending on the circumstances of death, other organizations might pay compensation:

- **SAAQ:** If the death was related to a car accident
- **CNESST:** If it was a workplace accident
- **Crime Victims Assistance Office:** If applicable

## Reorganizing Your Budget and Finances

**Income you keep:**
- Your own QPP pension
