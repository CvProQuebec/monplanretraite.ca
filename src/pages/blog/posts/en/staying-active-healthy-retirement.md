# How to Stay Active and Healthy in Retirement

Retirement is a beautiful stage of life. It's time to enjoy all that free time you've gained after years of work. But to really live these years well, you need to take care of your health and stay active.

## Why Health is So Important in Retirement

Your health is your most precious asset. Experts say it: the older you get, the more health costs can be expensive. A person who is 65 and in good shape has a good chance of living to 81 years old. And for a couple of the same age, one of them could even exceed 90 years!

That's why you need to prepare. Unfortunately, our body eventually ages. We can have problems like a heart attack or an accident that prevents us from moving like before.

## Health Costs to Plan For

According to studies, 65-year-old women risk losing their autonomy during the last 6 years of their life. For men, this period is about 3 years. The number of elderly people going to the hospital has increased a lot since 1987.

Nearly 4 out of 10 people say they wouldn't have enough money to pay for care for a long-lasting illness. It's important to think about this before it happens.

## How to Stay Fit in Retirement

### 1. Move Every Day

Physical exercise is the best way to stay healthy. You don't need to run a marathon! Simple activities can make a big difference:

- Walk 30 minutes a day
- Do gardening
- Swim or do aqua fitness
- Play golf (as we see in retirement planning images)
- Dance
- Ride a bike

### 2. Eat Well

Good nutrition helps you stay strong and avoid diseases. Think about:

- Eating lots of fruits and vegetables
- Choosing whole grains
- Getting enough protein (fish, meat, legumes)
- Drinking plenty of water
- Limiting sugar and salt

### 3. Keep Your Brain Active

Your head also needs exercise! Try these activities:

- Read books or newspapers
- Do crosswords or puzzles
- Learn something new
- Play cards with friends
- Take courses

### 4. Stay Connected with Others

Social relationships are very important for mental health:

- Spend time with your family
- Keep in touch with your friends
- Join a club or community group
- Volunteer
- Participate in your neighborhood activities

## Planning to Stay Active

### Budget for Your Leisure

In your retirement planning, don't forget to budget money for:

- Sports activities and fitness classes
- Sports equipment (bike, walking shoes, etc.)
- Subscriptions to recreation centers
- Travel that keeps you moving
- Supplementary health insurance

### Adapt Your Home

Think about making changes in your home to stay safe:

- Install grab bars in the bathroom
- Improve lighting
- Remove rugs that can cause tripping
- Have an easily accessible phone

## The Benefits of an Active Retirement

When you stay active in retirement, you gain a lot:

### For Your Body
- Your muscles stay strong
- Your bones keep their strength
- Your heart works better
- You have more energy
- You sleep better

### For Your Mind
- You feel happier
- You have less stress
- Your memory stays good
- You keep confidence in yourself

### For Your Wallet
- Fewer doctor fees
- Fewer medications to buy
- You can stay at home longer
- Less risk of accidents

## Starting Gently

If you haven't exercised in a long time, start slowly:

1. Talk to your doctor before starting
2. Choose activities you enjoy
3. Start with 10-15 minutes a day
4. Increase gradually
5. Listen to your body

## Simple Choices That Make a Difference

### Stop Smoking
Studies show that a person who doesn't smoke can live about 3 years longer. Those who smoke heavily can lose up to 9 years of life. In Quebec, life expectancy drops from 82 years to 73 years because of tobacco.

### Stay Mentally Active
Learn new things. You could:
- Give classes or do mentoring
- Offer your services to a school
- Share your DIY or cooking talents
- Get involved in a community organization

## Planning for Changes

Your retirement will last several years. Your needs will change over time:

- **At the beginning**: You'll be more active, you might travel more
- **In the middle**: Your activities may slow down a bit
- **Later**: You might need more health care

That's normal! The important thing is to prepare and adapt your activities according to your abilities.

## In Summary

Staying active and healthy in retirement is possible! You need to:

- Move every day, even a little
- Eat well
- Keep your brain busy
- Stay in contact with others
- Budget money for your leisure and health
- Adapt your home to be safe

Remember: you can take action today to improve your quality of life in retirement. Every little effort counts. Your future self will thank you!

Retirement is your time. Enjoy it by staying fit and healthy. You deserve it after all these years of work!
