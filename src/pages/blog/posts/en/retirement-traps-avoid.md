# How to Avoid the 7 Most Common Retirement Traps

## A Simple Guide for a Peaceful Retirement

You've worked hard all your life. You deserve a retirement without financial hassles. Yet, many people make costly mistakes that can cost them thousands of dollars.

Here are the 7 most dangerous traps to avoid to protect your money in retirement.

## Trap #1: Not Having a Tax Plan

**The problem:** Many retirees withdraw their money randomly, without thinking about taxes.

**The example:** A lady had $1.4 million in her RRSP. She waited until 72 to convert to RRIF. Result: she had to withdraw $135,000 that year. She lost all her Old Age Security pension and paid 38% in taxes.

**The solution:** Create a 20-year tax plan. Withdraw small amounts from your RRSP from age 60. Delay your CPP and OAS. Let your TFSA grow quietly.

## Trap #2: Withdrawing Money in the Wrong Order

**The problem:** The old rule says to empty your non-registered accounts first, then your RRSPs, then your TFSAs. This rule is outdated!

**The example:** A client sold his cottage, converted his RRSP to RRIF, and started his CPP the same year. Result: $63,000 in taxes instead of the usual $22,000.

**The solution:** Work with an advisor to create a "tax map". This map tells you exactly when to withdraw from which account and at what time.

## Trap #3: Keeping Too Much Cash

**The problem:** After market downturns, many people get scared and keep everything in cash.

**The example:** A couple had $2.1 million. They kept $900,000 in a savings account at 1.5%. Inflation was at 3%. They were losing money every day!

**The solution:** Use the "bucket" strategy:
- Bucket 1: Cash for your immediate needs
- Bucket 2: Bonds and dividends for your income
- Bucket 3: Stocks to grow your money
- Bucket 4: Alternative investments against inflation

You need all these buckets for a 25 to 30-year retirement.

## Trap #4: Not Planning for Emergencies

**The problem:** Life brings surprises: illness, accident, major repairs, spouse who dies.

**The risks:** If you don't have a "what if" plan, you might be forced to sell your investments at the wrong time.

**The solution:**
- Keep a liquid emergency fund
- Make sure your portfolio can survive a 20% to 30% drop
- Test your plan: "What if the market collapsed in my first 3 years of retirement?"

## Trap #5: Being Too Conservative with Your Investments

**The problem:** Many retirees think they must put everything in "safe" investments.

**Reality:** You must face inflation for 20 to 30 years. Experts recommend keeping 60% to 75% in stocks even at 75!

**Why:** Even if you retire at the worst time in history (1929, 1973, 2000, 2008), you're better off with stocks in your portfolio.

## Trap #6: Not Optimizing Government Benefits

**The problem:** Your RRIF withdrawals can reduce your OAS and GIS benefits.

**The example:** If your RRIF forces you to withdraw too much money, you might lose your Old Age Security.

**The solutions:**
- Use your younger spouse's age to calculate your RRIF
- Transfer your RRIF surpluses to your TFSA
- Plan your withdrawals to stay under recovery thresholds

## Trap #7: Not Having an Estate Plan

**The problem:** No will, no power of attorney, no plan for your heirs.

**Reality:** If you've saved well, your estate will pay taxes. The question is: 25%, 30%, or 50%?

**Real example:** A family saved $180,000 in taxes thanks to a well-planned family trust.

**The tools:** Life insurance, charitable donations, joint accounts, business estate freeze.

## How to Avoid These Traps?

### 1. Work with a Professional
A financial planner will help you create a personalized plan. Don't try to do everything alone.

### 2. Review Your Plan Every Year
Your needs change. Your plan must change too.

### 3. Think Long Term
Your retirement can last 30 years. Plan for this entire period.

### 4. Stay Informed
Tax rules change. Interest rates move. Stay up to date.

## Conclusion

You've worked too hard and saved too much money to mess it all up now. These 7 traps cost thousands of dollars to many retirees.

The good news? All these traps can be avoided with good planning.

Start now. Your future self will thank you.
