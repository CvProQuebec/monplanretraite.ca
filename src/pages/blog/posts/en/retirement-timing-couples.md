# What to Do When One Spouse Wants to Retire Before the Other

*Planning retirement as a couple is like dancing: sometimes you need to adjust your steps when one wants to move faster than the other!*

---

## When Love Doesn't Have the Same Rhythm

You've worked side by side for years. You've made plans together. But now one of you dreams of retiring earlier than the other. This situation is more common than you might think!

Maybe your spouse has had enough of their job. Or perhaps they're a few years older than you. Sometimes it's simply a matter of health or the desire to enjoy life.

Don't panic! This situation can be handled very well with planning and good discussions.

## Why Does This Situation Happen?

### Age Makes All the Difference

When there's an age difference in a couple, it's normal for one to want to leave before the other. If your spouse is 65 and you're 60, they can receive their full pension from the QPP (Quebec Pension Plan). You, however, will have to wait another 5 years to get the full amount.

### Different Careers

Your spouse might work in a field that's more physically demanding. Or they have a pension fund that allows them to leave earlier. Each work situation is unique.

### Different Desires

Some people dream of traveling while they're still in good health. Others want to take care of grandchildren or do volunteer work. It's perfectly normal to have different projects!

## How to Manage This Situation Well?

### 1. Review Your Finances Together

First of all, you need to know how much money you have. Calculate all your income:

**Your savings:**
- Money in your bank accounts
- Your RRSPs and TFSAs
- The value of your home
- Your investments

**Government income:**
- QPP (you can apply from age 60, but you'll receive less)
- Old Age Security pension (from age 65)
- Supplements if you need them

**Pension funds:**
- If one of you has a workplace pension fund
- The amounts you'll receive each month

### 2. Calculate How Much You Need Each Month

Most people need about 70% of their current salary to live well in retirement. But this depends on your plans!

If you want to:
- Travel a lot: you'll need more money
- Stay at home: you'll probably spend less
- Keep your house: think about maintenance costs
- Move to an apartment: you'll save on maintenance

### 3. Look at QPP Options

The QPP is Quebec's retirement plan. Here's what you need to know:

**At 60:** You receive only 64% of the amount (about $917 per month maximum)
**At 65:** You receive 100% of the amount (about $1,433 per month maximum)
**At 70:** You receive 142% of the amount (about $2,033 per month maximum)

*Important tip:* If you wait past 65, you gain 0.7% more for each month you wait!

## Solutions That Work

### Solution 1: Gradual Retirement

Your spouse can start by working part-time. This way, they keep an income but have more free time. Many people do this now!

### Solution 2: Split QPP Pensions

Did you know that a married couple can split their QPP pensions? If one of you earns much more than the other, you can share to pay less tax. It's like giving part of your pension to your spouse.

### Solution 3: Use Savings Wisely

If you have enough savings, one can retire and live on your savings while waiting for the other to be able to leave too. You just need to be careful not to spend everything!

### Solution 4: Review Your Expenses

Maybe you can reduce your costs:
- Sell one of the two cars
- Move to a smaller house
- Cancel subscriptions you don't use
- Cook at home more often

## Traps to Avoid

### Not Planning Early Enough

Start planning at least 5 years before retirement. The earlier you plan, the more options you have.

### Forgetting About Taxes

When you withdraw money from your RRSPs, you pay tax. You need to account for this in your calculations.

### Not Thinking About Healthcare

As you age, you'll probably spend more on your health. Keep some money aside for that.

### Making Decisions Alone

Retirement is planned as a couple! Talk about it together and make decisions together.

## When to Ask for Help

If you feel lost, that's normal! Retirement planning is complicated. Here's when it's time to ask for help:

- You don't know how much money you really have
- You're not sure you can afford for one to leave before the other
- You argue about money
- You're afraid of running out of money

A financial planner can help you. They'll look at your situation and give you personalized advice.

## The Important Thing is to Talk About It

The most important thing is to communicate well. Talk about your dreams, your fears, your desires. Retirement is a new chapter in your life. You can write it together!

Maybe one of you will leave a few years before the other. That's not a problem! With good planning, you can both enjoy this beautiful stage of life.

## In Summary

When one spouse wants to retire before the other:

1. **Review your finances together**
2. **Calculate your real needs**
3. **Look at all options (QPP, pension funds, savings)**
4. **Think about solutions like part-time work**
5. **Don't hesitate to ask for help from a professional**

Retirement is meant to be happy! With a little planning, you can achieve it together, even if you don't leave at the same time.
