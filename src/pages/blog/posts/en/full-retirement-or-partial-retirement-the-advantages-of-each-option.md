# Full Retirement or Partial Retirement? - The Advantages of Each Option

Retirement isn't what it used to be. Twenty years ago, most people completely stopped working at 65. Today, it's different. Many people choose to gradually slow down their work. Others continue working a few days a week. And some completely change careers.

Are you wondering which option is best for you? Full retirement or partial retirement? In this article, we'll look at the advantages and disadvantages of each choice. You'll be able to decide what suits you best.

## What is Full Retirement?

Full retirement is when you completely stop working. You close your office on Friday and never return to work on Monday. It's the traditional model that our parents and grandparents knew well.

### The Advantages of Full Retirement

**You have all your free time**
When you take full retirement, you no longer have schedules to follow. No more alarm clock at 6:30 AM. No more boss asking you to stay late. You can do what you want, when you want.

**Less stress**
Work can be stressful. Deadlines, meetings, problems to solve. When you stop completely, this stress disappears. You can finally rest.

**Time for your passions**
You may have always wanted to learn painting, do gardening, or travel. With full retirement, you finally have time to do these activities you always postponed.

**More time with family**
You'll be able to spend more time with your grandchildren, friends, or spouse. It's often what retirees appreciate most.

### The Disadvantages of Full Retirement

**Less money coming in**
When you completely stop working, your salary stops too. You must live only on your pensions and savings. For some people, this can be difficult.

**You might get bored**
Some people get bored when they completely stop working. They were used to being busy and active. Without work, they feel a bit lost.

**You lose your social contacts**
Work is also a place where you meet people. When you stop completely, you lose these daily contacts with your colleagues.

**Too abrupt change**
Going from 40 hours of work per week to zero hours is a big change. Some people have difficulty adapting.

## What is Partial (or Progressive) Retirement?

Partial retirement is when you gradually reduce your working hours. For example, instead of working 5 days a week, you work only 3 days. Or you work only in the morning. It's a gentler way to transition to retirement.

### The Advantages of Partial Retirement

**You keep a work income**
By working part-time, you continue to receive a salary. It's not your full salary, but it's still money coming in. This can help you financially.

**Smoother transition**
Instead of stopping overnight, you slow down gradually. It's less stressful and easier to accept mentally.

**You keep your social contacts**
By continuing to work a few days a week, you keep contact with your colleagues. You don't feel isolated.

**You stay active**
Working a few days a week keeps you active. It's good for your physical and mental health.

**You can test your retirement**
Partial retirement allows you to see how you feel with more free time. If you get bored, you can always increase your working hours.

**You continue contributing to your plans**
When you still work, you continue contributing to QPP and sometimes to your employer plan. This can increase your future retirement income.

### The Disadvantages of Partial Retirement

**You must agree with your employer**
To have partial retirement, your employer must agree. This isn't always possible with all jobs or all bosses.

**Your income decreases anyway**
Even if you keep some salary, your total income decreases. If you work 3 days instead of 5, you receive only 60% of your former salary.

**It's more complicated to organize**
You need to make special agreements with your employer and your retirement plans. It's more paperwork and more things to understand.

**You're not really retired**
You still have to respect certain schedules and responsibilities. You don't have the complete freedom of true retirement.

## How Does Partial Retirement Work in Quebec?

In Quebec, there are several ways to have partial retirement. Here are the main options:

### With the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)

**Option 1: Reduce your hours while keeping the same contributions**
If you're between 55 and 72, you can work less while contributing as if you still received your full former salary. Your employer must agree to this arrangement.

For example: you earned $50,000 per year working 5 days a week. Now, you work only 3 days and earn $30,000. But you and your employer contribute to QPP as if you still earned $50,000. This way, your future QPP pension doesn't decrease.

**Option 2: Receive your QPP pension while working**
From age 60, you can receive your QPP pension and continue working at the same time. If you receive your pension before 65, it will be reduced. But you'll still have pension income plus your part-time salary.

### With Your Employer Plan

If you have a retirement plan with your employer, there may be special options:

**Receive part of your pension while working**
Some plans allow you to receive up to 60% of your retirement pension while still working part-time. You must be between 55 and 64 and your employer must accept.

**Compensation for salary loss**
If you reduce your working hours, your plan can give you money to compensate for part of the salary loss. This amount cannot exceed 70% of the income loss.

## Who Should Choose Full Retirement?

Full retirement can be a good choice if:

**You have enough money saved**
If you saved well during your career and have enough money to live comfortably without working, full retirement can be perfect for you.

**You're tired of working**
If your work makes you very tired or makes you unhappy, it may be time to stop completely.

**You have health problems**
If your health prevents you from doing your job well, full retirement may be necessary.

**You have lots of projects**
If you have a long list of things you want to do (travel, volunteer, learn new things), you'll need all your time.

**Your job doesn't allow part-time**
Some jobs can't be done part-time. In this case, you have no choice: it's all or nothing.

## Who Should Choose Partial Retirement?

Partial retirement can be a good choice if:

**You don't have enough savings**
If you don't have enough money saved to live without working, continuing part-time can help you financially.

**You love your work**
If you love what you do but want to slow down, partial retirement is perfect.

**You're afraid of getting bored**
If you think you'll be bored without work, starting gradually can be wise.

**You want to test retirement**
If you're not sure how you'll feel in retirement, starting gradually can reassure you.

**Your employer is open to this option**
If your boss accepts letting you work part-time, it's a nice opportunity.

**You want to keep your insurance**
By still working a bit, you might keep your work insurance, which can be important for your health.

## How to Make Your Decision?

Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you choose:

### Questions about money
- Do I have enough savings to live without salary?
- Will my pensions (QPP, employer plan) be sufficient?
- Do I still have debts to repay?
- Do I want to leave an inheritance to my children?

### Questions about your work
- Do I still love my work?
- Does my work tire me a lot?
- Would my employer accept part-time?
- Does my type of work allow part-time?

### Personal questions
- How do I feel about change?
- Do I have projects that require a lot of time?
- Am I afraid of getting bored?
- Does my health allow me to continue working?

### Questions about your family
- Does your spouse still work?
- Do you want more time with your family?
- Is there someone in your family who needs your care?

## Retirement Has Changed

You should know that the way people retire has changed a lot. Before, people worked until 65 and stopped completely. Today, it's different.

**People live longer**
100 years ago, life expectancy was 52 years. Today, it's 82 years. This means your retirement could last 20 or 30 years. That's long!

**People are healthy longer**
At 65 today, most people are still in good health and capable of working. They don't want to stop completely.

**Employers need experience**
Many employers want to keep their experienced employees, even if they work fewer hours. They're open to part-time arrangements.

**People change careers**
Some people retire from their first career but start a new career in another field.

## Concrete Examples

### Marie, 62, nurse
Marie was a nurse in a hospital. Her work tired her a lot. She had saved enough money, so she chose full retirement. Now, she volunteers at the library and watches her grandchildren. She's very happy with her choice.

### Pierre, 64, accountant
Pierre loved his accounting work, but he wanted more time for himself. He made an agreement with his employer to work 3 days a week. He also receives part of his employer pension. This gives him enough money and enough free time. He thinks he'll continue like this until 67.

### Lucie, 60, teacher
Lucie was a teacher, but she wanted to try something else. She took full retirement from teaching, but she started working part-time in a bookstore. She earns less money than before, but she loves her new job.

## Practical Tips

### If you choose full retirement
- Calculate your retirement income well before stopping
- Prepare yourself mentally for the change
- Plan activities so you don't get bored
- Keep contact with your friends and family
- Stay physically active

### If you choose partial retirement
- Talk with your employer as early as possible
- Learn about the rules of your retirement plan
- Calculate your income well with this new formula
- Prepare for more administrative paperwork
- Keep flexibility to change your mind later

## You Can Change Your Mind

Remember: you don't have to make a final decision right away. You can start with partial retirement and move to full retirement later. Or, if you take full retirement and get bored, you can look for part-time work.

The important thing is to listen to your needs and do what makes you happy.

## In Summary

Full retirement and partial retirement each have advantages and disadvantages:

**Full retirement**: More freedom and less stress, but less money coming in and risk of getting bored.

**Partial retirement**: Smoother transition and additional income, but less freedom and more complications.

The best choice depends on your personal situation: your saved money, your health, your projects, your work, and what you really want.

Don't forget that you have the right to change your mind. Retirement is a new stage of your life. The important thing is that this stage is happy and fulfilling for you.

Take time to think about it well. Talk with your family, friends, and experts. And above all, make the choice that makes you happy!
