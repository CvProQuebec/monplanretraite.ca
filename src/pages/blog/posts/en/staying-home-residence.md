# Staying at Home or Moving to a Residence: Planning the Costs

As we age, an important question arises: is it better to stay in your home or move to a specialized residence? This decision affects your quality of life, your safety, and especially your budget. Here's a simple guide to help you calculate the costs and make the right choice.

## Why is This Question So Important?

As we age, our needs change. Statistics show that 65-year-old women will experience loss of autonomy for about 6 years at the end of their lives, and men for about 3 years. It's therefore important to plan for these years to avoid unpleasant financial surprises.

## The Costs of Staying at Home

### Basic Expenses

If you stay in your house, you must continue to pay:

**Monthly fixed costs:**
- Municipal and school taxes
- Home insurance
- Heating and electricity
- Basic maintenance (cleaning, routine repairs)
- Internet and telephone

**Simple example:** For a $300,000 house, even if it's paid off, costs can represent about $1,000 per month without counting major maintenance.

### Costs That Increase with Age

Aging at home, you might need:

**Home care services:**
- Housekeeping: $25 to $35 per hour
- Personal care: $35 to $50 per hour
- Meal preparation: $20 to $30 per hour
- Gardening and exterior maintenance: $25 to $40 per hour

**Accessibility renovations:**
- Access ramps: $2,000 to $5,000
- Adapted bathroom: $5,000 to $15,000
- Handrails in stairs: $500 to $2,000 per railing
- Door widening: $1,000 to $3,000 per door

### Available Financial Assistance

**Tax Credit for Home Maintenance**
- Available for Quebecers 70 years and older
- Covers expenses like housekeeping and snow removal
- Amount depends on your income and level of autonomy
- Keep all your receipts!

**Home Adaptation Program**
- Financial assistance to adapt your housing
- Available for autonomous seniors
- Can cover part of renovation costs

## Residence Costs

### Private Residences for Autonomous Seniors

These residences offer apartments with certain included services.

**Typical costs:**
- 1-bedroom apartment: $1,500 to $3,000 per month
- 2-bedroom apartment: $2,000 to $4,000 per month

**Often included services:**
- One or two meals per day
- Social activities
- Organized transportation
- 24/7 security
- Housekeeping

### Long-Term Care Centers (CHSLD)

For people who need constant medical care.

**Private subsidized CHSLDs (partially subsidized):**
- Maximum cost: $2,198.10 per month
- Healthcare is paid by the State
- Accommodation and meals are your responsibility
- Amount depends on your income

**Fully private CHSLDs:**
- Ã€ la carte services according to your needs
- Costs vary greatly according to required care
- Can cost $4,000 to $8,000 per month or more

**Important:** To be admitted to a subsidized CHSLD, you must not have given away your assets in the previous 2 years.

### Residences with Progressive Care

Some residences offer different levels of care according to your evolving needs.

**Advantages:**
- You stay in the same environment
- Care increases according to your needs
- More stability for you and your family

**Costs:**
- Autonomous level: $2,000 to $4,000 per month
- With light assistance: $3,000 to $5,000 per month
- Significant care: $4,000 to $7,000 per month

## Cost Comparison Over 10 Years

### Example: Marie, 70 years old, widow

**Option 1: Staying at home**
- Fixed house costs: $1,000 per month
- Assistance services (increase with age): $0 to $2,000 per month
- One-time renovations: $20,000 over 10 years
- **Total over 10 years: $200,000 to $400,000**

**Option 2: Senior residence**
- Monthly cost: $2,500 per month
- Annual increase: 3% per year (inflation)
- **Total over 10 years: about $345,000**

### Factors That Change the Calculation

**Your house has value:**
If you sell your $400,000 house and move to a residence, you have this money to pay your residence fees. Invested at 4%, this money could earn $16,000 per year.

**Your health condition:**
The more help you need, the more economical it can be to live in a residence where services are already organized.

## Hidden Costs to Consider

### If you stay at home

- Unexpected major repairs (roof, heating, plumbing)
- Increased energy costs
- Specialized medical equipment
- Adapted transportation if you no longer drive

### If you go to a residence

- Moving costs
- Storage of your belongings
- Registration fees and deposits
- Insurance for your personal belongings

## How to Make the Right Financial Decision?

### Assess Your Current Situation

**Ask yourself these questions:**
- What is the real cost of my house per month?
- What services do I need now?
- What services will I need in 5 years?
- Is my house safe for me?

### Calculate Your Available Income

**Your retirement income sources:**
- Old Age Security pension
- Quebec Pension Plan benefits
- RRIF or pension from your employer
- Personal savings
- Income from selling your house (if applicable)

### Plan for 20 to 30 Years

Retirement can last a very long time. A healthy 65-year-old man has good chances of living to 81, and a woman to 85. In a 65-year-old couple, there's a good chance that one of the two will exceed 90.

## The Impact of Inflation

Don't forget that costs increase each year. With 3% annual inflation, what costs $2,000 today will cost:
- $2,686 in 10 years
- $3,612 in 20 years

Your plan must account for these increases.

## Insurance to Consider

### Critical Illness Insurance
Can help you pay for special care or medical equipment if you stay at home.

### Long-Term Care Insurance
Specifically designed to cover residence costs or home care. Unfortunately, 39% of people say they couldn't afford to pay for a prolonged illness.

## Practical Tips for Deciding

### Visit Residences
- Go see different types of residences
- Talk with current residents
- Ask for a detailed list of all costs
- Check what happens if your needs change

### Evaluate Your House
- Have your house inspected by a professional
- Calculate the costs of accessibility upgrades
- Estimate major repairs needed in the next 10 years

### Consult Professionals

**Financial Planner:**
Can help you calculate if you have enough money for each option and optimize your retirement income.

**Occupational Therapist:**
Can evaluate your house and suggest adaptations to make it safer.

**Social Worker:**
Can inform you about assistance services available in your region.

## Questions to Ask Residences

- What services are included in the base price?
- How much do additional services cost?
- How much does the cost increase each year?
- What happens if I need more care?
- Is there a waiting list?
- Can I try before committing?

## The Emotional Side

This decision isn't just financial. Also think about:
- Your attachment to your house
- Proximity to your family and friends
- Your habits and routine
- Your need for social contacts
- Your sense of security

## In Summary

**Staying at home can be more economical if:**
- Your house is in good condition
- You're still in good health
- You have access to affordable assistance services
- Your family can help you

**Going to a residence can be more economical if:**
- Your house needs major renovations
- You need several assistance services
- Your house has a lot of value you can use
- You want the security and peace of mind

**Most important:** Start planning several years before you need to make this decision. Consult a financial planner who can do precise calculations according to your personal situation.

This decision will have a major impact on your finances and quality of life for the next 20 or 30 years. Take the necessary time to evaluate it well and don't hesitate to ask for professional help.
