# Managing Money Anxiety in Retirement

Are you approaching retirement and money worries you? You're not alone! Many Quebecers feel stress when they think about their finances. But good news: there are simple ways to feel more at peace with your money.

## You're Not Alone in Worrying

Did you know that 31% of Quebecers feel stress when they think about money? The Quebec Institute of Financial Planning tells us that this stress causes several problems:

- **42% of people** develop anxiety
- **29% of couples** fight because of money
- **26% of people** have difficulty sleeping

Money is a taboo subject for many people. More than 30% of Quebecers don't like talking about their finances with their family or friends. Yet, it's important to talk about it!

## Why We Worry So Much About Money in Retirement

Going from work to retirement isn't something you do on a whim! Several things worry us:

### The Most Common Fears
- **Living longer**: How to make sure money lasts long enough?
- **Markets that fluctuate**: When will investments go up or down?
- **Inflation**: Everything costs more every year!
- **The urge to spend**: The temptation to buy things we can't really afford
- **Government changes**: Will the programs stay the same?
- **Feeling useless**: Fear of no longer being important
- **Not having saved enough**: Feeling like we were the grasshopper instead of the ant

## The Fear of Losing Your Money

Experts explain something interesting to us: we all have a great fear of losing our money. This fear is often stronger than our desire to make it grow.

### An Example That Makes You Think

Imagine two choices for your savings:

**Choice 1**: Keep all your money in a regular savings account
- You can sleep peacefully
- But after 30 years, you have an 81% chance of running out of money!

**Choice 2**: Invest part of your money (even in retirement)
- It's a bit more stressful sometimes
- But your chances of keeping your money for a long time are much better

Studies show that if you retire at 65, with only money in a regular account, you could run out of money around 82 or 83 years old.

## How to Feel More at Peace with Your Money

### 1. Make a Budget (and it's not so bad!)

Making a retirement budget doesn't have to scare you or make you anxious. It can be easy! You just need to:

- **Know the right tools** to help you
- **Examine your expenses** one by one
- **Start simple** and improve over time

The simplest way to avoid money stress is to know how to make a budget... and do it!

### 2. Understand How Much You Really Need

**Good news**: You may not need as much money as you think!

- Experts often say you need 70% of your former salary
- But several specialists think 50% can be enough
- In retirement, you spend less on:
  - Work clothes
  - Lunch at restaurants
  - Gas to go to work
  - Office gifts

### 3. Have a Clear Vision of Your Situation

To worry less, you need to know your situation well. Ask yourself these important questions:

**About your family:**
- Are you married, single, common-law?
- Do you have children? Are they still at home?
- Do you help your parents financially?

**About your money:**
- How much do you have in your RRSPs?
- Is your house paid off?
- Do you have debts?
- What will your government income be?

### 4. Diversify to Sleep Better

Instead of putting everything in one place, spread your money:

- **Different countries**: Canada, United States, Europe
- **Different types of investments**: Stocks, bonds, savings
- **Different sectors**: Technology, health, banks

As the saying goes: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"

### Step 1: List everything that comes to mind (15 minutes)
- Sit down with a blank sheet
- Write down all the expenses that come to mind
- Look at your account and credit card statements
- Put everything in an "Expenses" folder

**Congratulations! You just did 40% of the work!**

### Step 2: Think about other expenses (20 minutes)
- Hairdresser, restaurants, clothes
- Leisure, travel, gifts

**Bravo! You've now done 80% of the work!**

### Step 3: Get out your calculator (30 minutes)

## How to Change Your Way of Seeing Money

### Think About Opportunities, Not Just Risks

Instead of asking yourself: "What will happen if I lose my money?"

Ask yourself instead: "How much could I have if I make the right choices?"

### Accept That a Little Risk is Normal

Studies prove it: if you take no risk with your money, you risk running out of money later. It's paradoxical, but it's true!

A balanced portfolio (for example 60% in stocks, 40% in bonds) can give you:
- The growth you need
- Protection against inflation
- Peace of mind

## When to Ask for Help

### Meet a professional if:
- You feel overwhelmed by your finances
- You can't sleep because of money
- You often argue with your spouse about money
- You don't know where to start

### What a financial planner can do for you:
- Help you see clearly in your situation
- Suggest strategies adapted to your needs
- Reassure you with a concrete plan
- Help you make good decisions

## If You Haven't Saved Enough

**Don't panic!** There are still solutions:

### Options to increase your income:
- **Part-time work**: Call your former boss, they might need your expertise
- **Paid volunteering**: Some organizations offer small incomes
- **Teach or mentor**: Share your know-how
- **Use your talents**: Cooking, DIY, crafts

### Options to reduce your expenses:
- **Sell a car**: Do you really need two cars?
- **Move to something smaller**: A cheaper house or apartment
- **Sell assets**: Cottage, boat, equipment you no longer use

## The Emergency Fund: Your Safety Cushion

### Why it's important:
An emergency fund is money set aside for unexpected events. It prevents you from stressing when something unexpected happens.

### How to build it:
1. **Start small**: Even $25 per month is a start
2. **Automate**: Set up an automatic transfer from your checking account
3. **Keep it separate**: In an account you don't normally touch
4. **Aim for 3 to 6 months** of essential expenses

## Tips for Sleeping Better at Night

### Change your way of thinking:
- **Instead of**: "What if I lose all my money?"
- **Think**: "I have a plan and I make thoughtful decisions"

### Remember that:
- Markets go up and down, but in the long term, they tend to go up
- You don't need to be perfect, just reasonable
- Even experts can't predict the future exactly
- Having a plan, even imperfect, is better than not having one

### Relaxation techniques:
- **Breathe deeply** when you feel anxious
- **Focus on what you control**: your expenses, your savings, your choices
- **Celebrate your small victories**: every dollar saved counts
- **Talk to someone**: family, friend, professional

## Government Programs: Your Safety Net

Don't forget that you're not alone! The government offers programs to help you:

### In Quebec:
- **Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**: Based on your years of work
- **Old Age Security Pension**: For all Canadians aged 65 and over
- **Guaranteed Income Supplement**: For those with low incomes

### These programs give you a foundation
Even if it's not enough to pay for everything, it gives you a solid foundation to build on.

## In Summary: Your Tools Against Anxiety

### To feel more in control:
1. **Make a simple and realistic budget**
2. **Diversify your investments** rather than keeping everything in savings
3. **Have an emergency fund** for unexpected expenses
4. **Meet a professional** if you feel overwhelmed
5. **Focus on what you control** rather than what you don't control

### Remember:
- **Making a budget can be easy** if you use the right tools
- **You may not need as much money** as you think
- **A little well-managed risk** is better than no risk at all
- **It's never too late** to improve your situation
- **You deserve to enjoy your retirement** without constant stress
