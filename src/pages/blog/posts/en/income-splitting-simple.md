# Income Splitting Explained Simply

## What Is Income Splitting?

Income splitting is a legal way to share your income with your spouse to pay less tax overall. It's like redistributing money between you two so each pays less tax.

**The golden rule:** Two low incomes are better than one high income!

## Why Does It Work?

### Our Tax System Works in Brackets

In Canada and Quebec, the more money you earn, the higher the tax rate on the last dollars earned.

**Here's how it works with concrete examples:**

**Example 1: A couple with unbalanced incomes**
- Pierre earns $40,000 → He pays about $5,991 in tax
- Marie earns $0 → She pays no tax
- **Couple's total tax: $5,991**

**Example 2: The same couple with balanced incomes**
- Pierre earns $20,000 → He pays about $685 in tax
- Marie earns $20,000 → She pays about $685 in tax
- **Couple's total tax: $1,370**

**Savings with income splitting: $4,621 per year!**

This is exactly what income splitting can save you.

## Types of Income Splitting

### 1. Pension Income Splitting (Most Common)

**What you can split:**

**Starting at age 65:**
- Your RRIF withdrawals (Registered Retirement Income Fund)
- Your employer pensions
- Your life annuities

**At any age:**
- Certain disability pensions
- Benefits from a registered pension plan

**How it works:**
- You can transfer up to 50% of this income to your spouse
- Your spouse will pay tax on this portion
- You pay tax on the rest

**How to do it:**
Fill out form T1032 with your tax returns. It's free and done once per year.

### 2. QPP Pension Sharing (Quebec Pension Plan)

**An often forgotten strategy!**

You and your spouse can ask Retraite Québec to share your QPP pensions between you.

**Conditions:**
- You must be married or common-law for at least 3 years
- You must both be 60 or older
- At least one of you must receive their QPP pension

**Possible savings:**
If one spouse receives the maximum ($1,433 per month) and the other receives nothing, savings can reach up to **$4,583 per year**!

**How to do it:**
Contact Retraite Québec and request pension sharing. It's free and permanent once approved.

**Important to know:**
- It's not necessarily 50-50
- The calculation takes into account your years of marriage and contributions
- To share, you must both exchange: impossible to give without receiving

### 3. Spousal RRSPs (To Plan While You're Working)

**Attention: You need to plan ahead!**

While you're working, the higher-earning spouse can contribute to the other spouse's RRSP.

**The advantage:**
- The contributor gets the tax deduction
- The other spouse will pay less tax when withdrawing

**The 2-year rule:**
If you withdraw money from a spousal RRSP within 2 complete calendar years after the contribution, the contributor pays the tax.

**Too late in retirement:**
If you didn't do spousal RRSPs while working, it's too late now. But you can use other types of splitting!

## Who Can Benefit?

### Income splitting only works if:

**1. There's an income difference between spouses**
- If you both have the same income, it's useless
- The greater the difference, the greater the savings

**2. You're recognized spouses**
- Married
- Civil union
- Common-law (according to each program's rules)

**3. You have eligible income**
- Not all income can be split
- Check the list of eligible income

## Simple Calculation: Is It Worth It?

### Concrete Example: Retired Couple

**Current situation:**
- Robert, 67: $35,000 income (employer pension + QPP)
- Sylvie, 65: $15,000 income (QPP only)

**Without splitting:**
- Robert pays about $4,200 in tax
- Sylvie pays about $200 in tax
- **Total: $4,400**

**With splitting (Robert transfers $10,000 to Sylvie):**
- Robert: $25,000 → pays about $2,100 in tax
- Sylvie: $25,000 → pays about $2,100 in tax
- **Total: $4,200**

**Annual savings: $200**

The greater the income difference, the greater the savings!

## Other Splitting Methods

### For couples still planning

**1. Pay spouse's expenses**
- The higher-earning spouse pays all couple's expenses
- The other spouse can save all their income
- The accumulated savings belongs to them

**2. Prescribed rate loan**
- The wealthy spouse lends money to the less wealthy spouse
- At the rate prescribed by the government (very low)
- The other spouse invests this money and keeps the gains

**3. Gift for TFSA**
- Give money to your spouse so they contribute to their TFSA
- TFSA income belongs to the spouse who received the gift
- No attribution rules apply

### For families with children

**1. Gifts to adult children for their TFSA**
- You can give money to your adult children
- They contribute to their TFSA with this money
- TFSA income belongs to them

**2. Registered Education Savings Plan (RESP)**
- Allows some splitting with children
- Taxable withdrawals are made in the child's name (lower tax rate)

## How to Start

### Step 1: Assess Your Situation

**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. Is there a big difference between your income and your spouse's?
2. Do you have income eligible for splitting?
3. Are you married, civil union, or recognized common-law?

### Step 2: Calculate Potential Savings

**Quick calculation:**
- Add up your taxable incomes
- Divide by 2
- See if this distribution would make you pay less tax overall

**Free tool:**
Use the Quebec Ministry of Finance calculator to estimate your taxes in different scenarios.

### Step 3: Fill Out Forms

**For pension splitting:**
- Form T1032 (federal)
- Form TP-1029.8.R-V (Quebec)
- To fill out each year with your returns

**For QPP pension sharing:**
- Contact Retraite Québec
- Fill out their application form
- It's permanent once approved

### Step 4: Plan for the Future

**If you're not retired yet:**
- Think about spousal RRSPs
- Plan your retirement income to maximize splitting
- Consult a financial planner

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Attribution Rules

**Beware of gifts between spouses!**
- If you give money to your spouse for them to invest, the income comes back to you fiscally
- Exception: gifts to contribute to TFSA

### 2. Consequences in Case of Separation

**Pension splitting is less risky:**
- Unlike spousal RRSPs, pension splitting doesn't create ownership
- In case of separation, each keeps their pension

### 3. Forgetting to Renew Each Year

**Pension splitting is not automatic:**
- You must fill out forms each year
- If you forget, you lose that year's savings

### 4. Splitting When It's Not Advantageous

**It doesn't work if:**
- You already have balanced incomes
- The spouse receiving income would lose important tax credits
- It would cause loss of government benefits

## When to Ask for Help

### Consult a professional if:

**1. Your situation is complex**
- Multiple income sources
- Variable income year to year
- Complicated family situation

**2. The amounts are significant**
- If you can save more than $1,000 per year
- Consultation fees often pay for themselves

**3. You're planning your retirement**
- To optimize your future income
- To choose the best savings vehicles

## Your 5-Step Action Plan

### This Week
1. **Calculate your current taxable income** (you and your spouse)
2. **Identify which income is eligible** for splitting
3. **Estimate potential savings** with a tax calculator

### This Month
1. **Request QPP pension sharing** if you're eligible
2. **Prepare pension splitting forms** for your returns

### This Year
1. **Fill out splitting forms** with your tax returns
2. **Calculate your real savings** after receiving your notices of assessment

## The Important Message to Remember

### Splitting is legal and encouraged!

The government created these rules to allow couples to pay less tax. This isn't "aggressive tax planning" - it's using the rules as they were designed.

### Every Dollar Counts

In retirement, your income is often fixed. Every tax dollar saved through splitting is one more dollar for:
- Your leisure and travel
- Your financial security
- Gifts to your children and grandchildren

### Start Now

The earlier you start splitting your income, the more you'll save overall. Even if the savings seem small the first year, they accumulate year after year.

### An Inspiring Example

**Claude and Denise, retirees aged 68:**
- Started splitting 5 years ago
- Save $1,800 per year
- Total saved: $9,000 in 5 years
- Used this money for a trip to Europe!

## Summary

Income splitting is:
- **Simple**: a few forms to fill out
- **Legal**: encouraged by the government
- **Profitable**: can save you thousands of dollars
- **Accessible**: available to most couples
- **Permanent**: savings accumulate year after year

Don't wait! Start planning your income splitting now. Your wallet will thank you!
