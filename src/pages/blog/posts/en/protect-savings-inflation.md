# How to Protect Your Savings from Inflation

Inflation is like a silent thief that attacks your savings. Day after day, it erodes your purchasing power without you noticing. But good news: there are simple and effective ways to protect your money. Let's see together how to do it.

## What is Inflation?

**Inflation is simply the rise in the cost of goods and services over time.**

**A concrete example:** In 1943, a stamp cost 3 cents in Canada. In 2016, that same stamp cost $1.00. That's inflation at work!

**Today in Quebec:** The Bank of Canada normally aims for 2% inflation per year. But sometimes, it can reach 5%, 6% or even 7%.

### Why is Inflation Dangerous for Your Savings?

**The cumulative effect is impressive:** With 3% inflation per year, the price of things doubles after just 24 years!

**Practical example:** With $1,000 per month today, you might be able to pay your rent. But in 15 years, that same rent could cost much more while your $1,000 will be worth much less.

## The Danger of Keeping Too Much Cash

### The Story of the Millionaire Couple

A couple had $2.1 million. But careful: $900,000 was sitting in a savings account earning only 1.5% per year.

**The problem:** Inflation was over 3%. Result? They were **losing money** every year!

**How it works:**
- They earned 1.5% on their cash
- But inflation "stole" 3% of their purchasing power
- **Real loss:** 1.5% per year!

### Why Cash Makes You Poorer

**Money that sleeps is money that gets poorer:**

1. **Inflation erodes it every day**
2. **You pay tax** on the small interest earned
3. **The result:** Your purchasing power constantly decreases

**Important:** You need some cash for emergencies (3 to 6 months of expenses). But no more!

## The Best Ways to Protect Your Savings

### 1. Invest in Stocks

**Why stocks protect against inflation:**
- Companies can raise their prices when inflation goes up
- Historically, stocks beat inflation over the long term
- Even in retirement, you should keep stocks in your portfolio

**Expert advice:** "Even during your retirement, own lots of stocks." Experts recommend keeping stocks even after 65.

### 2. Diversification: Your Best Friend

**Never put all your eggs in one basket!**

**Good diversification includes:**
- **Canadian stocks** (to benefit from our economy)
- **International stocks** (to reduce risks)
- **Quality bonds** (for stability)
- **High-yield bonds** (for more income)
- **Different regions of the world** (to balance economic cycles)

**The advantage:** When some investments go down, others go up. Overall, you're protected.

### 3. Don't Forget About Bonds

**Bonds are not dead!**

When the economy is doing poorly:
- Stocks often fall
- Central banks reduce interest rates
- Bonds can then rise in price

**The trick:** Diversify your bonds too:
- Government bonds (safer)
- Corporate bonds (more yield)
- Bonds with different maturities

### 4. Take Advantage of Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Use your RRSPs and TFSAs wisely:**

**TFSA - your first choice:**
- Tax-free growth
- Withdrawals without tax consequences
- Perfect for growing your money

**RRSP - to reduce your taxes now:**
- Immediate tax deduction
- Tax-sheltered growth
- Good when your tax rate is high

## Specific Strategies by Age

### If You're 50 and Over

**Your priorities:**

1. **Keep stocks (at least 40-60%)** even if you're approaching retirement
2. **Diversify globally** - don't stay only in Canada
3. **Balance with bonds** to reduce volatility
4. **Maximize your TFSAs** - it's gold in retirement

### If You're Already Retired

**Don't be too cautious!**

**The danger:** Many retirees put all their money in savings accounts or guaranteed investment certificates (GICs). This is a mistake!

**Reality:** Your retirement could last 20, 25 or even 30 years. You need growth to beat inflation during all this time.

**The "bucket" strategy:**
- **Bucket 1:** Cash for your immediate needs (1-2 years)
- **Bucket 2:** Bonds and stable investments for the medium term (3-7 years)
- **Bucket 3:** Stocks for long-term growth (8+ years)

## Mistakes to Absolutely Avoid

### 1. Keeping All Your Money in Cash

**The most expensive mistake:** Thinking that cash is "safe". In reality, inflation steals money from you every day.

### 2. Panicking During Market Downturns

**Remember March 2020:**
- Markets fell 35% in one month because of COVID
- Many people sold out of fear
- But markets recovered very quickly
- Those who stayed invested did well

**Lesson:** Markets always end up recovering from crises.

### 3. Not Diversifying Enough

**The trap:** Concentrating only on a few stocks or one country.

**Example:** Between 1996 and 1999, only a few technology companies were rising. Everyone wanted to buy them. Then from 1999 to 2002, these same companies fell 50%.

**The lesson:** Diversification protects you against these extreme cycles.

## How Inflation Affects Different Types of Income

### Your Government Pensions

**Good news:**
- Old Age Security pension is indexed to inflation
- Quebec Pension Plan too

**Bad news:** These pensions only cover about 40% of your needs. You need other income.

### Your Employer Pensions

**Warning:** Many employer pensions are NOT indexed to inflation.

**What this means:** If you receive $2,000 per month today, you'll still receive $2,000 in 15 years. But that $2,000 will be worth much less!

**The solution:** Compensate with investments that grow with inflation.

## Simple 5-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Assess Your Current Situation

**Questions to ask yourself:**
- How much cash do I have?
- How long has this money been sitting idle?
- Do my current investments beat inflation?

### Step 2: Keep the Right Amount in Cash

**The rule:** 3 to 6 months of expenses in cash, no more.

**Where to put it:**
- High-interest savings account
- Short-term TFSA
- Quickly accessible account

### Step 3: Invest the Rest Wisely

**Suggested allocation (adjusted according to your age and situation):**
- **40-70% in stocks** (Canadian and international)
- **20-40% in bonds** (different types)
- **10-20% other investments** (according to your situation)

### Step 4: Use Your Tax-Advantaged Accounts

**Priorities:**
1. **TFSA first** (tax-free growth)
2. **RRSP if you're in a high tax bracket**
3. **Regular accounts** for the surplus

### Step 5: Rebalance Regularly

**Once a year:**
- Check your percentages
- Rebalance if necessary
- Adjust according to changes in your life

## Concrete Examples of Protection

### Example 1: Marie, 55 years old

**Situation:** $200,000 in a savings account at 2%
**Problem:** With 3% inflation, she loses 1% per year
**Solution:**
- Keep $30,000 in cash (6 months of expenses)
- Invest $120,000 in diversified stocks
- Place $50,000 in quality bonds

**Expected result:** Her savings grow faster than inflation.

### Example 2: Jean-Claude, 68-year-old retiree

**Situation:** $500,000 in GICs at 3%
**Problem:** With 3% inflation, his purchasing power stays stable, but he has no safety margin
**Solution:**
- $100,000 in cash and GICs (for 4-5 years of needs)
- $200,000 in diversified stocks (for growth)
- $200,000 in varied bonds (for stability)

**Result:** Protection against inflation AND more stable income.

## When to Ask for Help

### Consult a professional if:

- You don't know how to diversify your investments
- You're afraid of making the wrong choices
- You have large amounts to invest
- You're approaching retirement
- You lose sleep because of your finances

**Important:** A good advisor will help you create a personalized plan according to your situation.

## What to Remember

**Inflation is your enemy:** It silently erodes your savings every day.

**Cash is not safe:** It's even risky in the long term!

**Diversification is essential:**
- Stocks to beat inflation
- Bonds for stability
- Different regions and sectors

**Start now:** The longer you wait, the more inflation costs you.

**Stay the course:** Markets go up and down, but in the long term, they beat inflation.

**Examples of historical returns:**
- Cash: 1-2% per year
- Inflation: 2-3% per year (sometimes more)
- Diversified stocks: 6-8% per year long term
- **Winner:** Stocks!

**The most important message:** Your retirement can last 30 years. You need investments that grow during all this time. Money sleeping in a savings account won't do the job.

**Remember:** When inflation is at 3%, the price of your purchases doubles in 24 years. Make sure your savings double too!
