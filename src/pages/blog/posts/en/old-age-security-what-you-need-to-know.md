# Old Age Security (OAS): What You Need to Know

## Your Guaranteed Money from the Government at 65

The Old Age Security pension, which we simply call OAS, is your money. You're entitled to it simply because you've lived in Canada long enough. No need to have worked. No need to have contributed anywhere.

Here's everything you need to know so you don't lose anything.

## What is Old Age Security?

### A Pension for All Canadians

OAS is a monthly check that the Government of Canada sends you when you turn 65. It's your right. You've earned it by living here.

**How much do you receive?**
- **65 to 74 years:** up to $734.95 per month (in 2025)
- **75 years and over:** up to $808.45 per month (in 2025)

The government increases these amounts 4 times per year to follow the cost of living.

## Who is Entitled to OAS?

### The 3 Simple Conditions

To receive your OAS, you must:

1. **Be 65 or older**
2. **Be a Canadian citizen or legal resident**
3. **Have lived in Canada at least 10 years since age 18**

That's it! No other complicated conditions.

### How Much Will You Receive?

The amount depends on how many years you've lived in Canada:

- **40 years or more in Canada:** You receive the full amount
- **Less than 40 years:** Your amount will be reduced

**Simple example:** If you've lived 30 years in Canada, you receive 30/40 = 75% of the maximum amount.

## Warning: OAS Clawback

### When the Government Takes Back Your Money

If you earn too much money, the government will recover part or even all of your OAS pension. This is called "clawback."

**The dangerous thresholds (2025):**

- **$90,997 income:** The government starts taking back your OAS
- **$148,451 income (65-74 years):** You lose all your OAS
- **$154,196 income (75 years and over):** You lose all your OAS

### How Does it Work?

For every dollar of income above $90,997, the government takes back 15 cents of your OAS.

**Concrete example:**
- Your income: $100,000
- Amount above threshold: $100,000 - $90,997 = $3,003
- Clawback: $3,003 Ã— 15% = $450.45
- You lose $450.45 of your OAS for the year

## Strategies to Protect Your OAS

### 1. Monitor Your RRIF Withdrawals

Your RRIF withdrawals count as income. The more you withdraw, the more you risk losing your OAS.

**Tip:** Withdraw only the mandatory minimum if possible.

### 2. Use Your TFSA Wisely

Money you withdraw from your TFSA does **not** count as income. It's your best weapon!

**Strategy:** If your RRIF withdrawals make you exceed $90,997, use your TFSA instead for your extra expenses.

### 3. Plan Your Investment Sales

When you sell stocks or funds, capital gains count in your income.

**Tip:** Spread your sales over several years to avoid a big income year.

### 4. Delay Your OAS if You Can Afford It

You can wait until age 70 to start your OAS. Each month of waiting increases your pension by 0.6%.

**Advantage:** If you wait 5 years (until 70), your OAS increases by 36% for life!

## The Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS)

### Extra Money for Low Incomes

If your income is low, you might also receive GIS in addition to your OAS.

**Who's entitled:**
- You already receive OAS
- Your annual income (not counting OAS) is under $22,272 (single) or $29,424 (couple)

**How much:** Up to $1,097.75 per month in addition to your OAS!

**Important:** GIS is **not** taxable. It's net money in your pocket.

## The Allowance and Allowance for the Survivor

### For 60-64 Year Olds

If you're between 60 and 64 and your spouse receives OAS, you might be entitled to the Allowance.

If you're widowed between 60 and 64, you might be entitled to the Allowance for the Survivor.

**Maximum amounts:**
- **Allowance:** $1,395.73 per month
- **Allowance for the Survivor:** $1,663.81 per month

## How to Apply?

### Simple Steps

**For OAS:**
1. Apply 6 months before you turn 65
2. Call Service Canada or go to their website
3. Prepare your documents: birth certificate, proof of residence

**Automatic enrollment:** If you already receive CPP or QPP, Service Canada might automatically enroll you for OAS.

### Important Documents to Keep

- All your tax returns
- Proof of residence in Canada
- Birth and citizenship certificates
- Immigration papers if applicable

## Mistakes to Absolutely Avoid

### 1. Forgetting to Apply

OAS is **not** automatic! You must apply.

### 2. Not Monitoring Your Income

Many people lose their OAS without realizing it because they exceed the clawback thresholds.

### 3. Confusing OAS and QPP

These are two different programs:
- **OAS:** Based on your years of residence in Canada
- **QPP:** Based on your work contributions

### 4. Neglecting GIS Applications

If your income is low, don't forget to also apply for GIS. It's free money!

## Tax Planning with OAS

### OAS is Taxable

Unlike GIS, your OAS pension is taxable. The government withholds tax at source if you request it.

### Income Splitting with Your Spouse

You **cannot** split your OAS with your spouse like you can do with your QPP.

### Impact on Your Other Benefits

Your OAS can affect:
- Your tax credits for seniors
- Certain provincial programs
- Your drug insurance benefits

## Special Cases

### If You've Lived Abroad

Canada has agreements with several countries. Your years lived in these countries might count for your OAS.

**Countries with agreements:** France, United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and several others.

### If You Live Abroad

You can generally keep your OAS if you live abroad, but there are special rules.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can I receive OAS if I still work?**
A: Yes! There's no obligation to retire to receive OAS.

**Q: Will my OAS increase with inflation?**
A: Yes, the government adjusts amounts 4 times per year according to inflation.

**Q: What happens if I move provinces?**
A: Nothing! OAS is a federal program, no matter where you live in Canada.

**Q: Can I receive OAS and continue contributing to my RRSP?**
A: Yes, as long as you have earned income and contribution room.

## Tips to Maximize Your OAS

### 1. Stay in Canada

Each year of residence counts. If you're thinking of moving abroad, wait until you have your full 40 years if possible.

### 2. Keep Your Income Under Control

Plan your RRSP/RRIF withdrawals to avoid OAS clawback.

### 3. Use a Financial Advisor

A good planner can help you structure your income to keep your OAS at maximum.

### 4. Stay Informed

Rules sometimes change. Follow the news or ask your advisor to keep you updated.

**Key points to remember:**
- Apply 6 months before you turn 65
