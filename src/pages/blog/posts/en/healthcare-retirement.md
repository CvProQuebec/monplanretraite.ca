# Healthcare in Retirement: What to Expect

## Your Health, Your Most Precious Asset

When you retire, your health remains your most important asset. But with age, you need to prepare for the fact that your health may change. Healthcare costs often increase as we age. This is normal, and it's better to prepare for it now.

## What to Expect as You Age

### Healthcare Costs Rise with the Years

The older you get, the more healthcare can cost. Here's why:

- You might need more medications
- Doctor visits become more frequent
- Some treatments aren't covered by Quebec's health insurance
- Dental care and glasses cost more as you age

### Risk of Serious Illness

At some point, you might suffer from a serious illness such as:
- A stroke
- A heart attack
- Diabetes
- Memory problems

These illnesses often require special and expensive care.

### Loss of Autonomy

Statistics tell us that:
- A 65-year-old woman will experience loss of autonomy during her last 6 years of life
- A 65-year-old man will be dependent during his last 3 years

When you lose your autonomy, you might need:
- Home care assistance
- Care in a specialized center
- Special medical equipment

## Costs to Plan For

### How Much Can It Cost?

Healthcare costs in retirement vary greatly from person to person. Here are examples of costs:

**Home care:**
- Home assistance: $20 to $30 per hour
- Private nurse: $40 to $60 per hour

**Accommodation in private CHSLD:**
- Prices can go up to $2,198.10 per month
- This amount depends on your income

**Non-covered medications:**
- Some medications cost hundreds of dollars per month
- Health supplements aren't always reimbursed

### The Impact of Inflation

Don't forget that costs increase over time. If a treatment costs $100 today, it could cost $130 in 10 years. This is called inflation.

## Your Current Protection

### What's Covered in Quebec

**The Régie de l'assurance maladie du Québec (RAMQ) covers:**
- Doctor visits
- Hospital stays
- Part of medications (with deductible)

**What is NOT covered:**
- Dental care (except emergencies)
- Glasses
- Several over-the-counter medications
- Private care
- Private home assistance

### Your Employer's Insurance

If you still have group insurance from your former employer:
- Only half of companies continue to cover their retirees
- Many companies reduce this coverage because of costs
- Check carefully what's still covered after your retirement

## How to Protect Yourself

### 1. Plan Your Healthcare Expenses

In your retirement budget, plan a special section for health. Here's how:

**Estimate your basic needs:**
- Regular medications
- Annual dental care
- Eye exams

**Plan for the unexpected:**
- Serious illness
- Need for home assistance
- Medical equipment

### 2. Consider Critical Illness Insurance

This insurance gives you money if you develop a serious illness such as:
- Cancer
- A heart attack
- A stroke

**Benefits:**
- You receive a lump sum
- You can use the money as you wish
- It helps you pay for non-covered expenses

**Things to know:**
- The longer you wait, the more expensive it becomes
- Certain medical conditions can prevent you from being accepted

### 3. Consider Long-Term Care Insurance

This insurance covers care when you lose your autonomy.

**It can cover:**
- Home assistance
- Care centers
- Special equipment

**Important points:**
- This insurance is expensive
- You need to take it when you're healthy
- Read the conditions carefully

### 4. Keep a Health Emergency Fund

Set aside money specifically for health:
- Start with $2,000 to $5,000
- Increase this amount each year
- Place this money in an easily accessible account

### 5. Take Care of Your Health Now

The best insurance is staying healthy as long as possible:

**Exercise regularly:**
- Walk 30 minutes a day
- Do activities you enjoy
- Keep your muscles strong

**Eat well:**
- Lots of fruits and vegetables
- Less sugar and fat
- Drink enough water

**Stop smoking:**
- Tobacco reduces your life expectancy by 9 years
- Non-smokers live 3 years longer on average

**Follow your treatments:**
- Take your medications as prescribed
- Go to your medical appointments
- Get your preventive exams

## Care Centers: What You Need to Know

### Public CHSLDs

**Advantages:**
- Less expensive
- Care covered by RAMQ

**Disadvantages:**
- Very long waiting lists
- Less choice in services

### Private Subsidized CHSLDs

**Costs:**
- Up to $2,198.10 per month
- The amount depends on your income

**Important to know:**
- You must not have given away your assets 2 years before admission
- An assessment of your income is necessary

## Your Important Documents

### Prepare Your Papers in Advance

**Notarized will:**
- Expresses your last wishes
- Safer than a holographic will

**Protection mandate:**
- Says who will take care of your affairs if you can no longer do so
- Specifies your wishes for medical care
- Must be confirmed by a court if necessary

**End-of-life directives:**
- Your wishes for the funeral
- Your medical wishes at the end of life

## Warning Signs According to Statistics

### What the Numbers Say

- 39% of people can't afford to pay for a prolonged illness
- Hospitalizations have doubled for those 75 and older since 1987
- A 65-year-old person has a good chance of living to 81
- In a 65-year-old couple, one of the two will probably exceed 90

### What This Means for You

- Expect higher healthcare costs after 75
- Financially prepare for a prolonged illness
