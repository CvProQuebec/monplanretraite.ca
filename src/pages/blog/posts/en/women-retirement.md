# Why Women Often Have Less Money in Retirement

## A Reality That Affects Many Women

Unfortunately, women often arrive at retirement with less money than men. This is a serious problem that affects many Quebec families. The numbers show it clearly: nearly 60% of people over 75 who receive the Guaranteed Income Supplement are women, compared to only 46% of men.

For women who are divorced or widowed, this situation becomes even more difficult. In this case, 70% of them need this government financial assistance to survive. These numbers show us there's a real problem to solve.

Understanding why this situation exists is the first step to better protect yourself and make the right decisions for your retirement.

## The Real Reasons Behind These Inequalities

### Lower Salaries Throughout Career

Unfortunately, women still often earn less money than men for the same work. This salary difference has an enormous effect on retirement. Here's why:

**The snowball effect:** If you earn less money, you contribute less to the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). You also put less money in your RRSP. Result: you have less money growing over time.

**Concrete example:** A woman who earns $40,000 per year will put $4,000 in her RRSP. A man who earns $50,000 will put $5,000. After 30 years, this difference of $1,000 per year can represent more than $100,000 less in retirement!

### Often Interrupted Careers

Women interrupt their careers more often than men. The main reasons are:

**To care for children:**
- Longer maternity leaves
- Stopping work when children are sick
- Choosing to stay home for a few years

**To care for aging parents:**
- Women often care for their elderly parents
- They reduce their work hours or stop completely
- This period can last several years

**Impact on retirement:** Each year without work is a year without QPP contribution and without retirement savings. It's also one less year of experience, which can affect future salary increases.

### Part-Time Work

Many women work part-time to balance family and work. The problem is that:

- Part-time salaries are often lower (per hour)
- There are fewer social benefits
- Employer retirement plans are less accessible
- QPP contributions are smaller

### Less Access to Employer Retirement Plans

Statistics show it: 67% of men have access to an employer retirement plan, compared to only 51% of women. This difference is explained because:

- Women work more often in sectors without retirement plans
- They hold more part-time or temporary jobs
- They change employers more often due to family responsibilities

## Long-Term Consequences

### Less Money from the Quebec Pension Plan

The amount of your QPP pension depends on how much you earned and contributed during your career. If you have:
- Earned less money
- Worked fewer years
- Had career interruptions

You'll receive a smaller pension. Currently, 97% of men 65 and over receive a QPP pension, compared to only 87% of women.

### Smaller Savings

With lower salaries and interrupted careers, women generally save less in their RRSPs and other investments. This difference accumulates over the years due to compound interest.

### More Difficulties in Retirement

These inequalities often lead to:
- Having to work longer
- Having a lower standard of living in retirement
- Depending more on government programs
- Having more financial stress

## How Women Can Protect Themselves

### Planning Despite Challenges

**Start early, even with small amounts:** Even if you can only save $25 per month, it's better than nothing. The important thing is to start and be consistent.

**Use the TFSA:** If your income is lower, the Tax-Free Savings Account can be more advantageous than the RRSP at the beginning of your career.

**Maximize your working years:** Try to work as many years as possible, even part-time, to increase your QPP contributions.

### During Career Interruptions

**Keep contact with the job market:** If possible, work a few hours per week or do contract work to maintain your skills.

**Continue saving if possible:** Even during parental leave, try to put a small amount aside each month.

**Buy back service if you can:** If you have an employer retirement plan, check if you can buy back missed years for your maternity leaves or other absences.

### Maximizing Government Programs

**Understand your rights:** Learn about the Guaranteed Income Supplement and Spousal Allowance if your income is lower.

**Plan as a couple:** If you're married or in a civil union, you might benefit from retirement income splitting to pay less tax.

## Special Advice for Different Life Stages

### Early Career (20-35 years)

- **Save automatically:** Even $50 per month makes an enormous difference over time
- **Invest in your training:** The more qualified you are, the higher your salary will be
- **Choose an employer with a good retirement plan** if possible

### During Family Years (35-50 years)

- **Don't let your RRSP sleep:** Continue contributing even if it's less than before
- **Use family tax credits:** The Canada Child Benefit can help you save
- **Plan your return to work:** Keep your skills up to date during leaves

### Before Retirement (50-65 years)

- **Catch up on lost time:** This is often when salaries are higher and children have left
- **Maximize your contributions:** Use accumulated RRSP contribution rights
- **Plan with a professional:** A financial planner can help you optimize your last years

## Special Challenges for Single Women

### Divorce and Separation

A divorce can completely upset your retirement plan. But you have rights:

- **Sharing retirement savings:** You might be entitled to part of your ex-spouse's RRSPs and retirement plans
- **QPP sharing:** Income contributed during marriage can be shared
- **Redo your planning:** A divorce is an opportunity to regain control of your finances

### Widowhood

Losing your spouse is difficult emotionally and financially:

- **Check your rights:** You might receive a survivor's pension from the QPP
- **Spouse's retirement plans:** Some plans pay a pension to the surviving spouse
- **Reorganize your finances:** Your needs and income have changed, adjust your budget

## The Importance of Getting Help

### Professionals to Consult

**Financial Planner:** They can help you create a plan adapted to your situation as a woman, even with a tight budget.

**Legal Advisor:** Especially in case of divorce or to understand your rights upon your spouse's death.

**Accountant:** To optimize your taxes and take advantage of all credits you're entitled to.

### Available Resources

**Retraite Qu√©bec:** To learn everything about the QPP and make simulations.

**Women's Groups:** Many organizations offer financial workshops for women.

**Free Financial Education:** Several financial institutions offer free courses.

## Changes Coming

### Good News on the Horizon

Things are gradually improving for women:

- **More women work:** The percentage of women contributing to the QPP increases each year
- **Better salary equality:** Gaps are slowly but surely decreasing
- **Shared parental leave:** More and more fathers take leave, which helps mothers

### What Still Needs to Be Done

- **Continue raising awareness:** More women need to understand the importance of saving early
- **Improve access to retirement plans:** Especially for part-time workers
- **Support families:** With better childcare services and family policies

## Your Rights and Protections

### In Case of Difficulties

**Social assistance:** If your income is very low, you might be entitled to assistance.

**Guaranteed Income Supplement:** This program helps seniors with low income.

**Spousal Allowance:** If your spouse receives the Old Age Security pension, you might also be entitled to assistance.

### Protection Against Discrimination

In Quebec, it's illegal to discriminate against women at work. If you think you're a victim of salary discrimination, you can:
- File a complaint with the Labour Standards Commission
- Request pay equity in your company
- Join a class action if necessary

## Inspiring Examples

### Marie, 45, single mother

Marie raised her two children alone while working part-time. At 45, she went back to school to become a nurse. Now, at 55, she's catching up on lost time by maximizing her RRSP contributions. Her advice: "It's never too late to regain control of your finances."

### Suzanne, 62, recently divorced

After 30 years of marriage, Suzanne found herself alone. With help from a financial planner, she obtained her share of her ex-husband's retirement savings. She now works part-time and plans to retire at 65 with decent income.

## In Summary: You Have Power

Yes, women face particular challenges for their retirement. But you're not without resources:

**What you can control:**
- Start saving early, even small amounts
- Learn about your rights and options
- Plan your career interruptions
- Maximize your working years
- Ask for professional help

**What you're entitled to:**
- Your share of family savings in case of separation
- Government assistance programs if necessary
- Salary equality at work
- Respect and consideration for your life choices

**Never forget:** Taking care of your family is important and noble. But taking care of your financial future is just as important. You deserve it, and your family will benefit too.

Retirement may seem far away, but every small action counts. Every dollar saved today will give you more freedom tomorrow. You have the right to live a dignified and comfortable retirement. It's never too early or too late to start planning it.
