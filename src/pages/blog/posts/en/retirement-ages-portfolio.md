# When Can I Retire? - The Different Ages and What This Changes in Your Portfolio

Retiring is no longer a binary decision where you work until 65 and then stop completely. Today, retirement planning offers remarkable flexibility, but this freedom of choice comes with financial complexity that must be mastered.

In Quebec, you can start receiving your government benefits from age 60, but each decision has lasting repercussions on your portfolio. Let's explore together the different scenarios and their financial impacts.

## Key Retirement Ages in Quebec

### 60 Years Old: The Possible Start, But at What Cost

From age 60, you can apply for your retirement pension from the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP). However, this decision comes with a permanent penalty of 0.6% per month of anticipation, a 36% reduction if you start at 60 instead of 65.

**Maximum monthly amount at 60:** $917.12

This strategy may be suitable if you have immediate financial needs, health problems, or shorter family life expectancy. But be careful: this reduction will follow you your entire life.

### 65 Years Old: The Reference Age

At 65, you receive 100% of your QPP pension, without penalty or bonus. This is also the eligibility age for Old Age Security (OAS) and the Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) for modest incomes.

**Maximum monthly amount at 65:** $1,433.00

This is often considered the "normal" retirement age, offering a balance between benefits received and payment duration.

### 70 to 72 Years Old: Maximum Bonus

Since 2024, you can defer your QPP pension until age 72 (previously 70). Each month of deferral after 65 increases your pension by 0.7%, for a maximum bonus of 58.8% at 72.

**Maximum monthly amount at 72:** $2,275.60

This strategy is particularly advantageous if you're in good health, have high family longevity, and have other income sources.

## Impact on Your Portfolio: Scenario Analysis

### The Profitability Calculation

According to available analyses, here are the approximate break-even thresholds:

- **Starting at 60 vs 65:** You need to live until about 73 for starting at 65 to become more profitable
- **Starting at 65 vs 72:** You need to live until about 83 for waiting until 72 to be profitable

### Life Expectancy Evolution

A crucial factor to consider: life expectancy has considerably increased. 100 years ago, it was 52 years, compared to 82 years currently, with upward projections. This trend favors benefit deferral strategies.

## Portfolio Optimization Strategies

### The 60% to 80% Rule

Experts estimate that you need between 60% and 80% of your work income to maintain your standard of living in retirement. For an annual income of $40,000, public plans replace about 40% of this amount. Personal savings therefore become crucial.

### The Importance of Supplementary Savings

#### RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)
- **2025 maximum contribution:** $32,490 or 18% of income
- **Advantage:** Immediate tax deduction
- **Disadvantage:** Withdrawals taxable in retirement

#### TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)
- **2025 maximum contribution:** $7,000
- **Advantage:** Non-taxable withdrawals
- **Strategy:** Ideal for avoiding recovery tax on OAS

### Optimal Withdrawal Order

Analyses show that withdrawal order can have a significant impact on your final net worth:

1. **Priority RRSP withdrawal:** Final net balance of $8,500
2. **Priority TFSA withdrawal:** Final net balance of $21,500
3. **Optimal balanced withdrawals:** Final net balance of $28,250
4. **Income splitting between spouses:** Final net balance of $42,000
5. **Government benefit deferral:** Final net balance of $279,000

## System News and Adaptations

The Quebec system adapts to modern realities:

### Increased Flexibility Since 2014
It's now possible to receive your QPP pension while continuing to work after 65, allowing a gradual transition to retirement.

### Recent Extension to 72
The extension of deferral age from 70 to 72 in 2024 recognizes life expectancy evolution and offers an additional bonus of 8.4% annually between 65 and 72.

## Special Considerations

### Recovery Tax
If your retirement income exceeds $86,912 (2023 data), you'll have to repay part of your OAS pension. This reality makes TFSA withdrawals particularly attractive for high incomes.

### Income Splitting
Couples can divide their pension income to reduce their overall tax burden. This strategy can be applied automatically for most income, but must be requested manually for QPP pension.

### RRIFs and Minimum Withdrawals
From age 72, minimum RRIF withdrawals increase progressively, reaching 20.0% at 95. This forced progression can affect your overall tax strategy.

## Practical Recommendations

1. **Evaluate your health situation and family longevity** before choosing the benefit starting age

2. **Maximize your RRSP and TFSA contributions** according to your current and projected tax bracket

3. **Consider income splitting** if you're in a couple

4. **Plan withdrawal order** from your different accounts to minimize tax impact

5. **Consult a financial planner** for a personalized strategy

## Conclusion

Retirement planning is no longer an exact science with a unique formula. The choices you make today regarding the starting age of your benefits can represent tens, even hundreds of thousands of dollars difference in your final net worth.

The current trend clearly favors government benefit deferral strategies, particularly with increasing life expectancy. However, each situation is unique and deserves thorough analysis.

The important thing is to make these decisions with full knowledge, using simulation tools available on Retraite Québec sites and getting support from qualified professionals. After all, as an expert so well reminds us: "Retirement is like a life project, and a life project needs to be planned."
