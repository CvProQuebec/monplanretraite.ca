## 🎯 **The \$100,000 Question: RRSP or TFSA?**

Every year, thousands of Quebecers ask themselves the same crucial question: *“I have \$5,000 to save for retirement. Should I put it into my RRSP or my TFSA?”*

**This decision can literally be worth a fortune.** Making the right choice can yield 20–30% more in the long run. Making the wrong one can cost you decades of lost growth.

### **The Simple (but Incomplete) Answer**

**RRSP if**: Current tax rate > Future retirement tax rate
**TFSA if**: Current tax rate < Future retirement tax rate

### **The Real Answer (and Why It’s More Complex)**

In reality, the optimal choice depends on **8 critical factors** most people ignore. This guide reveals them all.

## 🧮 **The Math Behind the Choice**

### **Fundamental Equation**

**Final RRSP value** = Capital × (1 + return)^years × (1 – future tax rate)
**Final TFSA value** = Capital × (1 + return)^years × 1.0

### **Case Study: Marie-Claude, Age 35**

**Situation**: \$5,000 to invest, 40% marginal tax rate, 6% annual return, 30-year horizon

#### **RRSP Scenario**

* **Contribution**: \$5,000
* **Tax refund**: \$2,000 (40%)
* **Net cost**: \$3,000
* **30-year growth**: \$28,717 (\$5,000 × 5.74)
* **Retirement tax (35%)**: –\$10,051
* **Net value**: **\$18,666**

#### **TFSA Scenario**

* **Contribution**: \$3,000 (same net cost as RRSP)
* **Tax refund**: \$0
* **30-year growth**: \$17,230 (\$3,000 × 5.74)
* **Retirement tax**: \$0
* **Net value**: **\$17,230**

**Result**: RRSP wins by **\$1,436** (8.4% more).

### **Critical Break-Even Point**

Marie-Claude should choose an RRSP if her retirement tax rate is **below 40%**.
She should choose a TFSA if her retirement tax rate is **above 40%**.

## 📊 **Comparative Simulation: 3 Scenarios Over 30 Years**

Base data: 35-year-old saver, \$8,000/year contributions, 6% return, 40% tax rate

* **Scenario A (100% RRSP)**: \$298,654 net
* **Scenario B (100% TFSA)**: \$275,680 net

## ✅ **Summary: Keys to Success**

1. **Tax diversification**: Never put all eggs in one tax basket
2. **Annual review**: Your situation changes, so must your plan
3. **Flexibility**: Keep liquidity (TFSA)
4. **Long-term vision**: Optimize for 30+ years
5. **Simplicity**: A simple strategy well executed beats a complex one poorly followed

**Winning formula for 90% of people**:

* **20–35 years**: TFSA first
* **35–50 years**: RRSP priority, TFSA as complement
* **50–65 years**: Sophisticated balance
* **65+ years**: Optimize withdrawals and estate planning

**Immediate action**: Every year of delay costs thousands in lost growth and missed tax optimization.
