# How Rising Cost of Living Affects Your Retirement

You've probably noticed that everything costs more than before. Groceries, gas, housing... This price increase, called inflation, particularly affects retirees. Here's how it can impact your retirement and what you can do to protect yourself.

## What Is Inflation?

Inflation is when prices increase over time. Here's a simple example: in 1943, a stamp cost 3 cents in Canada. In 2016, it cost $1.00. That's inflation!

**The Bank of Canada aims for 2% inflation per year.** But sometimes, it can go much higher:
- In the 1980s: over 10% per year
- Recently: between 5% and 7% per year
- Normally: between 1% and 3% per year

## Why Does Inflation Affect Retirees More?

### You No Longer Have a Salary That Increases

When you work, your boss can increase your salary to keep up with inflation. In retirement, it's different. Your income is often fixed:
- Government pension
- Employer pension
- Money from your savings

If these incomes don't increase at the same rate as prices, you lose purchasing power.

### A Concrete Example

Imagine you receive $1,000 per month in retirement. Today, that pays your rent. But in 15 years, with inflation, that same rent could cost $1,500. Your $1,000 won't be enough anymore.

## The Real Impact on Your Money

### What Inflation Costs

**With 3% inflation per year:**
- What costs $10,000 today will cost $20,000 in 24 years
- Your purchasing power is cut in half

**Here's what $10,000 today cost in the past:**
- In 1978: $2,837
- In 1988: $5,595
- In 1998: $7,211
- In 2008: $8,994

### Why It's Concerning in Retirement

If your retirement lasts 30 years (which is normal today), inflation can greatly reduce your standard of living. You must plan that your financial needs will increase each year.

## Expenses That Increase the Most

### Healthcare

The older you get, the more your healthcare costs increase. And these costs often rise faster than normal inflation:
- Medications
- Home care
- Senior residences
- Medical equipment

### Food and Energy

These basic expenses can vary greatly:
- Groceries can increase by 10% or more in certain years
- Heating and electricity often follow inflation
- Gas affects transportation costs

## How to Protect Yourself Against Inflation

### Check Your Government Pensions

**Good news:** Government pensions are often indexed:
- Old Age Security pension: adjusted 4 times per year
- Quebec Pension Plan: adjusted once per year

**Attention:** Check if your other pensions are indexed. Many employer pensions are not indexed or only partially indexed.

### Keep Investments That Beat Inflation

**Don't put all your money in savings accounts!** Here's why:

**Simple example:**
- Savings account: 2% per year
- Inflation: 3% per year
- Result: You lose 1% of purchasing power each year

**Solutions that protect against inflation:**

#### Stocks (Even in Retirement)
Contrary to what people think, you should keep stocks even in retirement. Experts recommend:
- 60% to 75% stocks in your portfolio
- Even at 70 or 80 years old!

**Why?** Because stocks generally rise faster than inflation over the long term.

#### Diversify Your Investments
- Canadian stocks
- US and international stocks
- Different types of bonds
- Mutual funds

### Plan Your Withdrawals Intelligently

**The 4% rule:**
- Withdraw 4% of your savings the first year
- Increase this amount by 3% each year to follow inflation
- Your money should last 30 years or more

**Example:**
- You have $500,000 saved
- First year: withdraw $20,000 (4%)
- Second year: withdraw $20,600 ($20,000 + 3%)
- And so on...

## Practical Strategies to Deal with Inflation

### Review Your Budget Regularly

**Each year, check:**
- Have your expenses increased?
- Are your incomes keeping up with inflation?
- Do you need to adjust your withdrawals?

### Stay Flexible

**If inflation rises a lot:**
- Reduce less important expenses
- Postpone large purchases
- Temporarily increase your withdrawals

**If inflation is low:**
- Take advantage to save
- Reduce your withdrawals if possible
- Invest in long-term improvements

### Consider Working Part-Time

More and more retirees are returning to work:
- To compensate for inflation
- To maintain their standard of living
- To have more financial security

## What You Shouldn't Do

### Don't Panic and Sell Everything

When inflation rises, some people:
- Sell all their stocks out of fear
- Put everything in savings accounts
- Stop investing

**This is a mistake!** History shows that stocks beat inflation over the long term.

### Don't Ignore Inflation

Some people think:
- "My needs will decrease in retirement"
- "Inflation won't affect me"
- "My savings will be enough"

**Reality:** Your financial needs will probably increase, especially for healthcare.

## Pensions That Don't Protect Enough

### Beware of Non-Indexed Pensions

If your employer pension is not indexed:
- It loses value each year
- After 20 years, it could be worth half as much
- Plan other income sources

### Partially Indexed Pensions

Some pensions increase, but not enough:
- 50% of inflation only
- Inflation minus 3% with a minimum of 0%
- These protections are insufficient

## A Plan to Protect Yourself

### Step 1: Take Stock
- What are your income sources?
- Which ones are indexed?
- How much do you have in savings?

### Step 2: Adjust Your Investments
- Keep stocks (60% to 75%)
- Diversify in several countries
- Don't put everything in bonds

### Step 3: Plan Your Withdrawals
- Use the 4% rule
- Increase your withdrawals with inflation
- Keep an emergency reserve

### Step 4: Monitor and Adjust
- Review your plan each year
- Adjust according to actual inflation
- Consult an advisor if necessary

## Summary

Inflation is a real challenge for retirees, but you can protect yourself:

**Important facts:**
- Inflation reduces your purchasing power each year
- It affects retirees more than workers
- A retirement can last 30 years: the impact accumulates

**Solutions:**
- Keep stocks in your portfolio
- Ensure your pensions are indexed
- Plan withdrawals that follow inflation
- Stay flexible and adjust your plan

**The most important message:** Don't be afraid of stocks, even in retirement. History shows they are your best protection against inflation over the long term.

Inflation is part of life. With good planning, you can maintain your standard of living throughout your retirement. Don't hesitate to consult a financial planner to adapt this advice to your personal situation.
