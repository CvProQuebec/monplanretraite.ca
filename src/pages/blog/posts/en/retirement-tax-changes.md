# Retirement Taxes: What Changes

## Your Tax Situation Changes When You Retire

When you were working, you received a salary from one source. In retirement, your money can come from several different places. Each source of money has its own tax rules. It's important to understand them to avoid unpleasant surprises.

## Your New Sources of Retirement Income

### 1. Government Benefits

**Old Age Security (OAS)**
- You're eligible at 65 if you've lived in Canada for at least 10 years
- Maximum amount: about $573 per month
- **Attention:** This pension can be clawed back by the government if your other income is too high

**Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**
- Depends on how much you contributed while working
- Maximum amount: about $1,093 per month
- You can apply at 60, but it will be reduced
- If you wait past 65, it will be higher

**Important:** Both these pensions are fully taxable. The money you receive is added to your other income to calculate your taxes.

### 2. Your Employer Pension

If you worked for a company that had a retirement plan:
- This pension is fully taxable
- It counts as "pension income" (important for certain tax credits)
- It can be split with your spouse in certain cases

### 3. Your RRSPs That Become RRIFs

**What Changes at 71**
Before 71, your money can stay in your RRSP without you paying tax on it. But at 71, you must convert your RRSP to a RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund).

**Mandatory Withdrawals**
Once you have a RRIF:
- You must withdraw a minimum amount each year
- All money withdrawn becomes taxable
- The older you get, the higher the minimum percentage

**Example of minimum withdrawal:**
- At 65: about 4% of your RRIF
- At 75: about 5.4% of your RRIF
- At 85: about 8.5% of your RRIF

### 4. Your Personal Investments

Money you've invested outside your RRSPs:
- Interest is 100% taxable
- Dividends have favourable tax treatment
- Capital gains are only 50% taxable

## New Tax Rules That Apply

### You Might Pay Less Tax

**Why?**
- Your income is often lower than before
- You're entitled to new tax credits
- You can split certain income with your spouse

**Special tax credits for retirees:**
- **Age credit**: If you're 65 and over
- **Pension income credit**: For your private pensions and RRIFs
- **Caregiver credit**: If you help a family member
- **Home support credit**: For certain home services

### Income Splitting: A Way to Save

**How it works**
Our tax system works in brackets. The more you earn, the higher your tax rate. If you can share your income with your spouse, you'll pay less tax overall.

**Concrete example:**
- One person with $40,000 income pays about $5,991 in tax
- Two people with $20,000 each pay about $1,370 total in tax
- **Savings: $4,621 per year!**

**Which income can be split?**

**At 65 and over:**
- Income from your RRIF
- Your employer pensions
- Life annuities

**At any age:**
- Disability pensions
- Certain insurance annuities

**How to do it:** You must fill out a special form with your tax returns. You can split up to 50% of this income.

### QPP Pension Sharing

**Another way to save**
You and your spouse can ask to share your QPP pensions.

**Conditions:**
- You must be married or common-law for at least 3 years
- You must both be 60 or older
- At least one of you must receive their QPP pension

**Important:** This sharing isn't necessarily 50-50. The calculation takes into account your contribution years and your common life.

## What Can Cost You More

### Old Age Security Clawback

**What is it?**
If your income exceeds a certain threshold, the government takes back part of your Old Age Security pension.

**2025 thresholds:**
- Clawback starts around $86,912 in income
- It can go up to 100% of your pension if your income exceeds $141,917

**How to avoid it?**
- Plan your RRIF withdrawals to stay under the threshold
- Use your TFSA instead of your RRIFs when possible
- Split your income with your spouse

### Tax Withholdings on Your RRSP Withdrawals

**If you withdraw money from your RRSP:**
- Less than $5,000: 19% withholding
- Between $5,001 and $15,000: 24% withholding
- More than $15,001: 29% withholding

**Important:** These withholdings are often insufficient. You might have to pay more tax at year-end.

## How to Plan Your Retirement Taxes

### 1. Choose the Right Time to Convert Your RRSP to RRIF

**You don't have to wait until 71**
- You can convert your RRSP to RRIF earlier if you want
- But think carefully: once converted, you must withdraw money each year

**A strategy: Spread your withdrawals**
Instead of making a large withdrawal that would make you pay a lot of tax, plan small withdrawals over several years.

### 2. Use Your TFSA to Your Advantage

**Why TFSA is wonderful in retirement:**
- Money you withdraw from it isn't taxable
- It doesn't increase your income for Old Age Security clawback
- If you don't need all your minimum RRIF withdrawal, put the surplus in your TFSA

### 3. Coordinate with Your Spouse

**If your spouse is younger:**
You can base your RRIF minimum withdrawals on your spouse's age. This reduces mandatory amounts and keeps more money tax-sheltered longer.

**Plan together:**
- Who withdraws money first?
- How to use income splitting?
- When to apply for your government pensions?

### 4. Right Timing for Your Government Pensions

**For Old Age Security:**
- You can delay it until 70
- It increases by 0.6% per month of delay (7.2% per year)
- If you don't need it right away, wait!

**For QPP:**
- Same principle: it increases by 0.7% per month after 65
- It can increase up to 42% if you wait until 70

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Forgetting to Plan for Old Age Security Clawback

Many people are surprised to have to repay part of their pension. Calculate your income in advance and plan accordingly.

### 2. Not Taking Advantage of Income Splitting

It's free money! If you're a couple and your incomes are unbalanced, splitting can save you thousands of dollars per year.

### 3. Making Large Withdrawals Without Planning

A large RRSP or RRIF withdrawal can push you into a higher tax bracket. It's often better to spread over two tax years.

### 4. Not Considering Your Spouse's Age

If your spouse is younger, use their age to calculate your minimum RRIF withdrawals. This can make a big difference.

## Your Action Plan

### This Year

1. **Calculate your expected retirement income**
   - Add all your income sources
   - Check if you risk exceeding clawback thresholds

2. **Meet with a financial planner**
   - They can help you optimize your withdrawals
   - They know all the rules and can save you money

3. **Organize your papers**
   - RRSP/RRIF statements
   - Government pension estimates
   - Information on your other investments

### Each Year After Your Retirement

1. **Review your withdrawal strategy**
   - Have your needs changed?
   - Are your incomes balanced with your spouse?

2. **Plan your taxes in advance**
   - Make estimates during the year
   - Adjust your withdrawals if necessary

3. **Stay informed about changes**
   - Tax rules sometimes change
   - Clawback thresholds are adjusted each year

## Special Benefits to Know

### Tax-Free Savings Accounts (TFSA)

**Why they're perfect in retirement:**
- No tax on withdrawals
- Don't affect your other benefits
- You can put back withdrawn money the following year

### The Possibility of Deferring Tax

Even in retirement, you can still defer tax:
- By managing when you make your RRIF withdrawals
- By using certain types of investments
- By planning with your spouse

## Summary: The Big Differences

### When You Were Working
- One salary, one tax source
- Automatic deductions each paycheck
- Little control over timing

### In Retirement
- Multiple income sources with different rules
- More flexibility on timing
- More strategies to save tax
- But also more responsibilities to plan

## The Important Message

The rules are there to help you save money. Use them to your advantage:
- Split your income if you're a couple
- Use your special tax credits
- Plan the timing of your withdrawals and pensions
- Don't hesitate to ask for professional help

Your retirement is time to enjoy your money. Good tax planning ensures you keep the maximum in your pockets!
