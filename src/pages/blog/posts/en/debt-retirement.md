# Should You Pay Off Your Debts Before Retirement?

One of the big questions that future retirees ask themselves: "Should I hurry to pay off my debts before I stop working?" The answer isn't always simple. It depends on several important factors that we'll examine together.

## The Golden Rule for Debts

**The main rule is simple:** financial planners are unanimous. **Your long-term debts should be paid off while you're still working.**

For example, if you buy a house at 40 and want to retire at 55, your mortgage should be paid off in 15 years maximum. Why? Because in retirement, your income will probably be lower than today.

## Types of Debts: Which Ones to Pay Off First?

### 1. High-Interest Debts (URGENT!)

**Pay off first:**
- **Credit cards** (often 18% to 24% interest)
- **High-rate personal loans**
- **Personal lines of credit**

**Why it's urgent?** These debts cost a lot in interest. Every month you wait, you pay more.

**Practical tip:** If you can't pay the full balance of your credit card each month, it's time to take drastic measures. The fees are enormous!

### 2. House Mortgage (IMPORTANT)

**The good news:** Mortgage interest is generally lower than credit cards.

**The rule:** Your mortgage should be paid off **before** your retirement, but you don't need to stress about paying it ultra-quickly.

**Warning!** Don't put yourself in misery to pay your mortgage faster. It's better to:
- Keep a good standard of living
- Continue saving for your retirement
- Pay your mortgage reasonably

**Special advantage:** When you sell your house, you don't pay tax on the gain. Your house generally increases in value over time.

### 3. Car and Equipment Debts (MODERATE)

**The rule:** Never finance a car longer than its normal lifespan.

- **New car:** maximum 4 years of financing
- **Used car:** even less

**Expert advice:** It's preferable to pay cash for your car. If you can't pay cash for it, maybe it costs too much for your means.

## Savings or Debt Repayment: What to Choose?

This is THE dilemma! Here's how to decide:

### The Interest Rate Comparison Rule

**Always compare:**
- The **interest rate** you pay on your debt
- The **return** you could get by saving

**Concrete example:**
- Your credit card costs 20% interest
- Your investments earn 5% per year
- **Decision:** Pay off the credit card first!

### Recommended Order of Priority

**1. Create a safety cushion first**
- Put the equivalent of 6 months' salary in your TFSA
- This is your emergency fund for unexpected events

**2. Pay off high-rate debts**
- Credit cards
- Expensive personal loans

**3. Balance between savings and repayment**
- If your investments earn more than your debts cost, continue saving
- Otherwise, focus on repayment

## Special Situations

### If You're Running Out of Time Before Retirement

**You're approaching retirement and still have debts?** Here are your options:

**Option 1: Delay retirement**
- Work a few more years
- Pay off your debts during this period

**Option 2: Reduce your standard of living in retirement**
- Accept lower income
- Budget taking debt payments into account

**Option 3: Sell assets**
- Sell your house for a smaller one
- Liquidate investments to pay off debts

### Reverse Mortgage: Be Careful!

Some people think about reverse mortgages. **Be very cautious!**

**The disadvantages:**
- Very high interest rates
- Your inheritance decreases rapidly
- Many complicated fees
- You risk losing your house

**Our advice:** Explore all other options before considering a reverse mortgage.

## The Psychological Impact of Debts in Retirement

### The Stress of Debt

More than 30% of Quebecers feel stress when they think about money. This stress causes:
- Anxiety (42%)
- Couple arguments (29%)
- Insomnia (26%)

**In retirement, this stress can be worse** because your income is fixed and lower.

### Peace of Mind

**Being debt-free in retirement means:**
- Sleeping peacefully at night
- Not worrying about bills
- Fully enjoying your retirement
- Having more money for leisure

## Practical Strategies for Success

### 1. Make a Realistic Budget

**Simple steps:**
- List all your income
- Note all your expenses
- Find where you can cut
- Allocate this money to debt repayment

### 2. Consolidate Your Debts

If you have several debts, **group them together:**
- One bill to pay
- Possibly a lower interest rate
- Easier to manage

### 3. Increase Your Payments Gradually

**Don't put yourself in misery!** Increase your payments little by little:
- Use your salary increases
- Apply your tax refunds
- Reduce one expense at a time

### 4. Automate Your Payments

**Make life easier:**
- Automatic withdrawals
- No risk of forgetting
- No temptation to spend this money elsewhere

## When It's Better to Save First

**Sometimes, it's preferable to save before paying everything off:**

### If Your Debts Have a Low Interest Rate

- 3% mortgage
- 2% car loan
- And your investments earn 5% or more

### If You Don't Have an Emergency Fund

**Always keep a safety cushion** before putting everything on debts. Emergencies happen!

### If Your Employer Contributes to Your RRSP

**Never miss free money from your employer!** Contribute at least enough to get the maximum employer contribution.

## Personalized Action Plan

### Step 1: Assess Your Situation

**List:**
- All your debts with their interest rates
- Your current savings
- Your emergency fund
- Your expected retirement income

### Step 2: Rank Your Debts by Priority

**From most urgent to least urgent:**
1. Credit cards
2. High-rate personal loans
3. Student loans
4. Car loan
5. Mortgage

### Step 3: Establish a Repayment Plan

**Calculate:**
- How much more you can pay each month
- How long it will take to pay off each debt
- If it's realistic before your retirement

### Step 4: Adjust as Needed

**If you're running out of time:**
- Consider delaying your retirement
- Or accept having some low-rate debts
- Or sell non-essential assets

## Mistakes to Absolutely Avoid

### 1. Completely Stopping Saving

**Never completely stop saving** to pay off your debts. Keep at least a small amount going into your savings.

### 2. Using Your RRSPs to Pay Your Debts

**Very bad idea!** You'll lose:
- Tax advantages
- Compound growth
- And you'll pay a lot of tax

### 3. Taking on New Debts

**While you're paying off**, avoid:
- New credit cards
- Financed purchases
- Non-essential loans

### 4. Neglecting Your Relationship

**Work together!** Money arguments are a major cause of relationship problems. Discuss your plan openly and make decisions together.

## When to Ask for Help

### Consult a professional if:

- You have to borrow to pay off other debts
- You can't make a realistic budget
- You constantly argue with your spouse about money
- You lose sleep because of your debts

**Remember:** Constantly postponing debt repayment means delaying your retirement time!

## What to Remember

**The short answer:** YES, you should generally pay off your debts before retirement.

**The exceptions:**
- Very low interest rate debts (less than 3-4%)
- If you don't have an emergency fund
- If your employer contributes to your savings

**The priorities:**
1. **Emergency fund** (6 months of expenses)
2. **High-rate debts** (credit cards)
3. **Balance** between savings and medium-rate debt repayment
4. **Mortgage** last (if the rate is low)

**The goal:** Have **peace of mind** and be able to fully enjoy your retirement without debt stress.

**Don't forget:** Each situation is unique. What works for your neighbor won't necessarily be the best solution for you. The important thing is to make a realistic plan and stick to it!
