# New Contribution Limits: What This Changes for You

The rules for saving in your retirement accounts have changed in 2025. These changes affect your RRSP and TFSA. Here's what you need to know to properly plan your retirement.

## New Amounts for 2025

### RRSP: More Money to Set Aside

For 2025, you can now contribute up to **$32,490** to your RRSP. This is an increase from previous years. For 2026, this amount will rise to **$33,810**.

How does it work? You can contribute **18% of your salary** from the previous year. But be careful, there's a maximum. Even if 18% of your salary gives more than $32,490, you cannot exceed this amount.

**Simple example:** If you earned $100,000 in 2024, 18% = $18,000. So you can contribute $18,000 to your RRSP in 2025.

### TFSA: It Stays the Same for Now

For the TFSA, the amount remains at **$7,000** per year in 2025. If you were born before 1991, you've accumulated **$102,000** in contribution room since the TFSA was created.

**Important:** If you withdraw money from your TFSA, you must wait until the following year to put it back. Otherwise, you risk a penalty.

## Why These Changes?

The government adjusts these amounts each year based on price and wage increases. When everything costs more, you need more money for retirement. That's why the limits increase.

## RRSP or TFSA: Which to Choose?

This question comes up often. Here's how to decide:

### Choose RRSP if:
- You earn a good salary now
- You think you'll earn less in retirement
- You want to reduce your taxes this year

### Choose TFSA if:
- You're young and your salary will increase
- You want to withdraw your money without paying tax
- You're not sure about your future situation

### A Concrete Example

Marie earns $80,000 per year. She can contribute $14,400 (18% of $80,000) to her RRSP. If she does this, she'll save about $5,760 in taxes this year (40% of $14,400).

Pierre earns $30,000 per year. He could contribute $5,400 to his RRSP, but he prefers to put $5,400 in his TFSA. This way, he can withdraw his money without paying tax later.

## Pitfalls to Avoid

### Don't Exceed the Limits

If you contribute too much:
- RRSP: 1% penalty per month on the excess amount
- TFSA: 1% penalty per month on the excess amount

### Check Your Contribution Room

For RRSP, look at your Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency. It tells you how much you can contribute.

For TFSA, log into your online account on the Canada Revenue Agency website. Be careful, this amount is only updated at the beginning of the year.

### Don't Forget Your Employer Contributions

If your employer contributes to a pension fund for you, this reduces your RRSP contribution room. This is called the "pension adjustment." You'll find it on your T4.

## When to Contribute?

### RRSP: Before March 1, 2026
You have until March 1, 2026, to contribute to your RRSP for the 2025 year. If you contribute before this date, you can deduct this amount from your 2025 taxes.

### TFSA: Anytime
You can contribute to your TFSA anytime during the year. But remember: if you withdraw money, you must wait until the following year to put it back.

## What This Changes for Your Retirement

These new limits give you more room to save. This is good news, especially since everything costs more today.

**A tip:** If you can't contribute the maximum, contribute what you can. Even $50 per month is better than nothing. Your unused contribution room accumulates for later.

## Beware of Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Contributing Too Late
Don't contribute to your RRSP after March 1. You would lose the tax deduction for the previous year.

### Mistake 2: Mixing Up RRSP and TFSA
Money withdrawn from an RRSP is always taxable. Money withdrawn from a TFSA never is.

### Mistake 3: Forgetting to Track Contributions
Keep a notebook or file to track what you contribute. This avoids unpleasant surprises.

## Summary

- RRSP 2025: maximum of $32,490
- RRSP 2026: maximum of $33,810
- TFSA 2025: maximum of $7,000 (same as 2024)
- Always check your contribution room before contributing
- Choose between RRSP and TFSA according to your situation
- Don't forget the deadlines

These changes give you more possibilities to prepare for your retirement. Take advantage of them! If you have questions, don't hesitate to consult a financial advisor. They can help you choose the best strategy for your situation.
