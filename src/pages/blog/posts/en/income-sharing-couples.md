# How to Share Retirement Income and Save on Taxes

*A Simple Guide to Understanding Your Retirement Options*

## Why Share Your Retirement Income?

When you retire, it's important to organize your income properly to pay as little tax as possible. One effective way to do this is to share certain income with your spouse or partner.

**The main idea is simple:** In Canada, the less money you earn, the less tax you pay. If one person in a couple earns a lot and the other earns very little, they can save money by sharing their income.

## How the Tax System Works in Quebec

The tax system in Quebec works with tax brackets. This means that:
- Your first earnings are not taxed at all
- The more money you earn, the higher your tax rate becomes

**Concrete example:** In 2025, you pay no tax on your first $16,129 of federal income and $18,571 of provincial income.

Imagine a couple where one person earns $40,000 and the other earns nothing. The first person would pay about $5,991 in taxes. But if each person earned $20,000, they would pay much less tax together!

## Main Ways to Share Your Income

### 1. Split Your Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) Benefits

This is a very interesting option for couples. You can ask Retraite Québec to split your retirement pension with your spouse or partner.

**Who can do this?**
- You must be married, in a civil union, or common-law partners for 3 years
- You must both be 60 years old or older
- At least one person must be receiving their QPP pension

**How does it work?**
- You apply to Retraite Québec
- The amount each person receives depends on your years of marriage and contributions
- It's not always exactly half of each pension

**Important:** This split doesn't change the amounts registered in your name in the system. It only serves to reduce your taxes.

### 2. Share Your Private Pension Income

Since 2007, you can allocate up to 50% of certain pension income to your spouse or partner. This includes:
- Income from a RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund)
- Annuities from your employer's retirement plan
- Certain other annuities

**Important advantage:** Unlike spousal RRSPs, this strategy allows you to share up to 100% of your eligible pension income.

### 3. Use Spousal RRSPs (Before Retirement)

If you're not yet retired, you can contribute to your spouse's or partner's RRSP. This strategy is very useful when one person in the couple earns much more than the other.

**How it works:**
- You contribute to your spouse's RRSP
- You get the tax deduction
- At retirement, your spouse pays the tax on this income
- If your spouse is in a lower tax bracket, you save money

## Sharing During Separation or Divorce

If you separate or divorce, certain retirement elements can be shared:

### QPP Income
- Sharing happens automatically for married couples or those in civil unions (unless you waive it)
- For common-law partners, you must apply within certain time limits
- Work income recorded during your life together is added up and shared equally

### Employer Retirement Plans
- Sharing depends on the type of plan and applicable laws
- It's generally recommended to proceed with sharing quickly
- Fees may apply

### RRSPs, RRIFs and Other Accounts
- Sharing is possible but rules vary
- They must be valued at market value
- Eligible ex-spouses depend on applicable laws

## Important Points to Remember

### Seek Professional Help
Before making important decisions about sharing your retirement income, consult:
- A qualified financial planner
- A tax specialist
- The administrators of your retirement plan

### Do Your Calculations
- Request a simulation before making a decision
- Compare the advantages and disadvantages for each person in the couple
- Think about long-term consequences

### Act at the Right Time
- Some strategies are more effective if you plan them before retirement
- Others can be implemented during retirement
- Deadlines are important for certain applications

## What to Avoid

- **Don't delay your decisions:** The longer you wait, the fewer options you have
- **Don't neglect the details:** Each situation is unique
- **Don't forget other consequences:** Sharing can affect other government benefits

## Summary

Sharing your retirement income can save you a lot of money on taxes. The main strategies are:

1. **Split your QPP pension** with your spouse
2. **Share your private pension income** (up to 50%)
3. **Use spousal RRSPs** before retirement
4. **Properly organize sharing** in case of separation

Remember that each situation is different. What works for one couple may not suit another. That's why it's essential to consult professionals to help you make the best decisions for your situation.

Retirement planning is like building a house: you need good foundations and the right tools. Income sharing is one of these powerful tools that can help you keep more money in your pockets!
