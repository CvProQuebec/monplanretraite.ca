# QPP and CPP: When to Apply to Get the Maximum

## Your Guide to Maximizing Your Government Pensions

The QPP (Quebec Pension Plan) and CPP (Canada Pension Plan) are your government pensions. It's money you've earned by working. But **when** you apply for them can make you gain or lose thousands of dollars.

Here's everything you need to know to make the right decision.

## QPP vs CPP: What's the Difference?

### One Pension, Two Names

- **QPP:** If you worked in Quebec
- **CPP:** If you worked elsewhere in Canada

It's the same thing! If you worked in both, you receive one pension that combines everything.

**How much can you receive?** In 2025, the maximum QPP/CPP pension is **$1,433 per month** at age 65.

## The Golden Rule: Timing Changes Everything

### Your 3 Main Options

**Option 1: At 60 (early)**
- You receive: **$917 per month** (64% of the full pension)
- Permanent reduction: **36%** less than at 65

**Option 2: At 65 (normal)**
- You receive: **$1,433 per month** (100% of the full pension)
- This is the "normal" reference age

**Option 3: At 70 (late)**
- You receive: **$2,035 per month** (142% of the full pension)
- Permanent bonus: **42%** more than at 65

**Option 4: At 72 (maximum)**
- You receive: **$2,276 per month** (158.8% of the full pension)
- Maximum bonus: **58.8%** more than at 65

### How Does it Work?

**Before 65:** You lose 0.6% per month early
- 1 year earlier = 7.2% less
- 5 years earlier = 36% less

**After 65:** You gain 0.7% per month delay
- 1 year later = 8.4% more
- 5 years later = 42% more
- 7 years later = 58.8% more (maximum)

## Strategy 1: Apply Early (60-64 years)

### When it's the Right Decision

**✅ Take your QPP/CPP early if:**

1. **You need money now**
   - You can't pay your bills
   - You have no other income
   - You must choose between eating and waiting

2. **Your life expectancy is reduced**
   - You have serious health problems
   - Your doctor tells you that you probably won't live very old
   - It's better to have less money now than no money at all

3. **You want to enjoy while you're healthy**
   - You want to travel in your early retirement years
   - You have projects that cost money
   - You prefer less money now to enjoy it

### Concrete Example

Marie is 60 and has heart problems. Her doctor tells her she probably won't live beyond 70.

- **If she takes her pension at 60:** $917 × 12 months × 10 years = **$110,040**
- **If she waits until 65:** $1,433 × 12 months × 5 years = **$85,980**

Marie should take her pension at 60!

## Strategy 2: Wait (66-72 years)

### When it's the Right Decision

**✅ Wait if:**

1. **You have other sources of income**
   - You're still working
   - You have RRSPs/RRIFs
   - You have investments
   - You receive an employer pension

2. **You're in good health**
   - Your parents lived old
   - You don't have major health problems
   - You think you'll live at least until 78-80

3. **Your other income is high**
   - The more income you have, the more taxes you pay
   - Waiting can save you on taxes

### The Magic Calculation: 12 to 15 Years

**Break-even point:** It takes about **12 to 15 years** to recover what you lose by waiting.

**Example:** Jean hesitates between 60 and 65.

- **At 60:** $917 per month
- **At 65:** $1,433 per month
- **Difference:** $516 more per month by waiting

**Break-even calculation:**
- Money lost by waiting 5 years: $917 × 60 months = $55,020
- Time to recover: $55,020 ÷ $516 = 107 months = **9 years**

If Jean lives more than 9 years after 65 (so until 74), he gains by waiting!

## Strategy 3: Wait Until 70-72 (for the wealthy)

### When it's Great

**✅ Wait until 70-72 if:**

1. **You're wealthy**
   - You have lots of savings
   - You don't need this money now
   - You want to leave more to your heirs

2. **You want to beat inflation**
   - A bigger pension protects you better against price increases
   - It's like insurance against cost of living

3. **You'll probably live very old**
   - Your parents lived into their 90s
   - You're in excellent health
   - You don't smoke, you exercise

### Robert's Example

Robert is 65, has $500,000 in savings and excellent health. His parents lived until 92.

**Option A: Take at 65**
- $1,433 per month until 92 = $1,433 × 324 months = **$464,292**

**Option B: Wait until 70**
- $2,035 per month until 92 = $2,035 × 264 months = **$537,240**
- **Gain by waiting: $72,948**

Robert should wait! He gains almost $73,000 more.

## Traps to Absolutely Avoid

### Mistake #1: Forgetting About Taxes

Your QPP/CPP is **taxable**. The more you receive, the more taxes you pay.

**Tip:** If your other income is already high, waiting might make you pay more taxes later.

### Mistake #2: Not Looking at Your Complete Situation

Don't decide just with QPP/CPP. Look at:
- Your other income
- Your health
- Your money needs
- Your family situation

### Mistake #3: Following What Others Do

Your neighbor took his pension at 60? Good for him! Your situation is different.

### Mistake #4: Not Applying

The government does **not** send you your pension automatically. You must apply for it!

## Important Special Cases

### If You're Married or in a Couple

**Income splitting:** From age 65, you can share up to 50% of your pension with your spouse to pay less taxes.

**Couple strategy:** If one spouse is sick and the other healthy, the sick one can take their pension early and the other wait.

### If You're Divorced

Your earnings are **automatically shared** with your ex-spouse for the years you were married. You don't have to do anything.

### If You're Widowed

You're entitled to a **survivor's pension** in addition to your own pension. Apply for it!
