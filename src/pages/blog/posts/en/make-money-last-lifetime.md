# How to Make Your Money Last Your Whole Life

Are you worried about running out of money in retirement? This fear is normal and shared by many people. With increasing life expectancy, our savings now need to last longer than before.

Here are the most effective strategies to ensure your money accompanies you until the end of your days, regardless of your age today.

## The Big Challenge: Living Longer with the Same Money

### Life Expectancy is Increasing

Today, a 60-year-old has good chances of living:
- **Men:** until age 86
- **Women:** until age 89
- **45% of people** will live beyond 90

This means your retirement could last 25 to 30 years! That's almost as long as a complete career.

### Your Expenses Don't Really Decrease

Many people think they'll spend less as they age. **This is a mistake!**

Your expenses change, but don't necessarily decrease:
- **65-75 years:** More travel, leisure, projects
- **75+ years:** More healthcare, home help, adapted transportation

Expenses remain high, but for other reasons.

## Strategy 1: The 4% Rule (The Foundation of Everything)

### What is it?

It's a simple rule to know how much you can withdraw from your savings each year without risking running out of money.

**The rule:** Never withdraw more than 4% of your savings per year.

### How Does it Work?

If you have $500,000 saved, you can withdraw:
- **$500,000 × 4% = $20,000 per year**
- **Or $1,667 per month**

**Concrete example:**
Lucie is 65 and has $300,000 saved. With the 4% rule, she can withdraw $12,000 per year, or $1,000 per month, for about 30 years.

### Why 4%?

This rule has been tested over 50 years of financial history. Even during the worst economic crises (1930, 1970), a balanced portfolio survived 33 years with this rule.

For this to work, your investments must earn an average of 7% per year:
- **4%** for your withdrawals
- **3%** to compensate for inflation

## Strategy 2: Create Multiple Investment Horizons

### The Common Mistake

Many people think: "I'm retired, I must put everything in safe investments."

**This is wrong!** You have several time horizons:
- **Short term (1-5 years):** Money for your immediate needs
- **Medium term (5-15 years):** Money for later
- **Long term (15+ years):** Money for your old age

### The Bucket Strategy

**Bucket 1 - Immediate needs (1-5 years):**
- Keep 5 years of expenses in safe investments
- Savings accounts, bonds, investment certificates

**Bucket 2 - Medium term (5-15 years):**
- Balanced mix of stocks and bonds
- Balanced funds, diversified ETFs

**Bucket 3 - Long term (15+ years):**
- More stocks to beat inflation
- Stock funds, quality individual stocks

**Example:**
Robert, 67, has $600,000:
- **$200,000** in safe investments (5 years of expenses)
- **$200,000** in a balanced fund
- **$200,000** in stocks for growth

## Strategy 3: Maximize Your Guaranteed Income

### Why is This Important?

Guaranteed income protects you against the risk of living too long. Even if your savings run out, you still have money coming in.

### Your Guaranteed Income Sources

**1. Old Age Security (OAS)**
- Maximum $800.44 per month at 75 (in 2025)
- **Strategy:** Delay it until 70 for 36% more for life

**2. Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**
- Maximum $1,433.00 per month at 65 (in 2025)
- **Strategy:** Delay until 72 for 58.8% more for life

### Example of Strategic Delay

Marie can receive:
- **At 65:** OAS of $728 + QPP of $1,200 = $1,928 per month
- **By delaying to 70 (OAS) and 72 (QPP):** OAS of $990 + QPP of $1,905 = $2,895 per month

**Difference:** $967 more per month, for life!

## Strategy 4: Prepare Your Withdrawal Plan

### The Order of Withdrawal

Don't withdraw randomly! The order matters to minimize taxes:

**1. Non-registered accounts first**
- No additional tax on capital
- Allows keeping RRSP/TFSA tax advantages longer

**2. RRSP/RRIF in the middle**
- Taxable withdrawals, but strategic
- Watch out for mandatory minimum withdrawals at 72

**3. TFSA last**
- No tax, total flexibility
- Keep it as an emergency reserve

### Managing Mandatory RRIF

At 72, you MUST withdraw from your RRIF:
- **At 72:** 5.40% of the value
- **At 80:** 6.82% of the value
- **At 90:** 11.92% of the value

**Strategy:** Start partially emptying your RRSP/RRIF before 72 to avoid forced withdrawals that are too high.

## Strategy 5: Prepare for the Unexpected

### The Emergency Fund

Even in retirement, keep an emergency fund:
- **3 to 6 months** of expenses easily accessible
- In a savings account or TFSA
- For major repairs, healthcare, etc.

### Important Insurance

**Supplementary health insurance:**
- Covers medications, dental care, physiotherapy
- Costs increase with age

**Long-term care insurance:**
- For home help or housing
- Can cost $3,000 to $8,000 per month

## Strategy 6: Regularly Adjust Your Plan

### Annual Review

Every year, check:
- Your actual vs. planned expenses
- Your investment performance
- Your health and life expectancy
- Changes in your family situation

### Be Flexible

Your plan must adapt:
- **Good financial years:** Maybe increase your withdrawals
- **Bad years:** Temporarily reduce non-essential expenses
- **Health changes:** Adjust according to your new needs

## Concrete Action Plan by Age

### If You're 50-60 Years Old

1. **Calculate how much you'll need** (25 times your planned annual expenses)
2. **Maximize your RRSP/TFSA contributions** now
3. **Start planning your withdrawal** with a financial planner
4. **Consider delaying your pensions** if you have enough savings

### If You're 60-70 Years Old

1. **Finalize your withdrawal plan** before retirement
2. **Evaluate delaying your government pensions**
3. **Adjust your investments** according to the bucket strategy
4. **Prepare your RRIF** if you're approaching 71

### If You're 70 and Over

1. **Monitor your mandatory RRIF withdrawals**
2. **Keep part of your investments in stocks** to beat inflation
3. **Use your TFSA** as a flexible reserve
4. **Review your plan** every year according to your health

## Mistakes That Can Ruin You

### ❌ Mistake 1: Putting Everything in "Safe" Investments

**Why it's dangerous:** Inflation will erode your purchasing power over 20-30 years.

**Solution:** Keep part in stocks even in retirement.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Withdrawing Too Much Money in the Early Years

**Why it's dangerous:** Your capital will never recover.

**Solution:** Respect the 4% rule and adjust according to the years.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Planning RRIF Withdrawals

**Why it's dangerous:** You might lose your OAS and pay more tax.

**Solution:** Start withdrawing from your RRSP before 72.

### ❌ Mistake 4: Ignoring Inflation

**Why it's dangerous:** What costs $100 today will cost $180 in 20 years at 3% inflation.

**Solution:** Your investments must earn more than inflation.

## What to Remember

**To make your money last your whole life:**

✅ **Follow the 4% rule** - Never withdraw more than 4% per year

✅ **Diversify your horizons** - Short, medium and long term with adapted investments

✅ **Maximize your guaranteed income** - Delay your pensions if possible

✅ **Plan your withdrawal** - The order of withdrawals matters for taxes

✅ **Keep an emergency fund** - 3-6 months of accessible expenses

✅ **Review annually** - Adjust according to reality

**The secret:** Start planning now, regardless of your age! The earlier you start, the more options you have and the less stress you'll have.

## Next Steps

1. **Calculate your needs** - How much does your current life cost?

2. **Evaluate your current savings** - Where are you compared to your needs?

3. **Consult a financial planner** - For a personalized plan according to your situation

4. **Start implementing the strategies** - Even small changes make a big difference

5. **Review every year** - Your plan must evolve with your life

Remember: making your money last your whole life isn't luck, it's planning. The strategies exist, you just need to apply them according to your situation!
