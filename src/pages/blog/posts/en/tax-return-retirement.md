# Preparing Your Retirement Tax Return

Preparing your tax return when you're retired is different from when you were working. Your income sources have changed and there are new tax credits you can benefit from. Here's a simple guide to help you prepare your return stress-free.

## Your New Types of Retirement Income

### Government Pensions

**Old Age Security (OAS):**
- You receive it if you've lived in Canada for at least 10 years
- Maximum amount: $734.95 per month (ages 65 to 74)
- Maximum amount: $808.45 per month (age 75 and over)
- **Important:** This pension is taxable

**Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) or Canada Pension Plan (CPP):**
- Based on your working years of contributions
- Maximum amount: approximately $1,092 per month
- **Important:** This pension is also taxable

### Your Personal Savings

**RRIF (Registered Retirement Income Fund):**
- This is your former RRSP converted
- You must withdraw a minimum amount each year
- **Attention:** All withdrawals are taxable

**Employer Pension:**
- If you had a pension fund at work
- **Important:** These amounts are taxable

**TFSA:**
- **Good news:** Withdrawals are never taxable
- You have nothing to declare for your TFSA

## Tax Slips You'll Receive

### T4A(OAS) - Old Age Security
This slip indicates how much you received in OAS pension. Enter this amount in your tax return.

### T4A(P) - QPP or CPP
This slip shows your QPP or CPP pensions. These amounts go in your tax return.

### T4RIF - RRIF
If you have a RRIF, you'll receive this slip. It shows:
- How much you withdrew
- How much tax was withheld at source

### T4A - Employer Pension
If you receive a pension from your former employer, this slip indicates the amounts received.

## Where to Enter Your Income in the Return

### If You're 65 Years or Older

**Line 11500 - Eligible Pension Income:**
Enter here:
- Your RRIF withdrawals
- Your employer pension
- Your QPP/CPP pension

**Why it's important:** This income gives you the right to the pension income credit.

### If You're Under 65

**Line 13000 - Other Income:**
If you're not 65, most of your retirement income goes here, except pensions received due to your spouse's death.

## Special Tax Credits for Retirees

### Age Credit (65 and over)

**Who can get it:** Anyone 65 and over
**How much it's worth:** Can reduce your taxes by several hundred dollars
**Attention:** This credit decreases if your income is too high

### Pension Income Credit

**Who can get it:**
- All retirees 65 and over who receive pension income
- Younger people who receive a pension due to their spouse's death

**How much it's worth:** Up to $2,000 of your pension income is protected by this credit

**Which income counts:**
- RRIF
- Employer pension
- QPP/CPP (if you're 65 and over)

### Other Possible Credits

**Caregiver credit:** If you care for a family member
**Medical expense credit:** For your health expenses

## Strategies to Pay Less Tax

### Pension Income Splitting

**How it works:** You can give up to 50% of certain pension income to your spouse on paper.

**Benefits:** If your spouse earns less than you, your family will pay less tax overall.

**Which income can be split:**
- RRIF (if you're 65 and over)
- Employer pension
- Certain other pensions

**How to do it:** Fill out form T1032 with your return.

### QPP Pension Sharing

**How it works:** You and your spouse can share your QPP pensions.

**Conditions:**
- You must both be 60 or older
- You must be married or common-law for at least 3 years
- You must both receive a QPP or CPP pension

**How to do it:** Apply directly to Retraite Qu√©bec.

## Beware of Common Errors

### Insufficient Tax Withholding

**The problem:** Often, tax withholdings on your pensions aren't high enough.

**The solution:**
- Check if you owe tax at year-end
- If so, ask to increase withholdings for the following year
- Or make installment payments

### Forgetting to Declare All Income

**Check that you've included:**
- All your government pensions
- All your RRIF withdrawals
- Your employer pension
- Interest from your non-registered investments

### Missing Tax Credits

**Don't forget to claim:**
- Age credit
- Pension income credit
- Your medical expenses
- Your charitable donations

## Old Age Security Clawback

### What Is It?

If your income is too high, you'll have to repay part of your OAS pension.

**2024 threshold:** $90,997
**How it works:** You repay 15% of income exceeding this threshold

**Example:**
- Your income: $100,000
- Excess: $9,003 ($100,000 - $90,997)
- Repayment: $1,350 (15% of $9,003)

### How to Avoid the Surprise

**Monitor your RRIF withdrawals:** The more you withdraw, the higher your income.

**Plan with your spouse:** Income splitting can help you stay under the threshold.

## Practical Tips for Preparing Your Return

### Organize Your Documents

**Before starting, gather:**
- All your tax slips (T4A, T4RIF, etc.)
- Your non-registered investment statements
- Your medical expense receipts
- Your charitable donation receipts

### Use Software or Consult a Professional

**For retirees, it's often more complicated:**
- Multiple income sources
- Special tax credits
- Splitting strategies

**Don't hesitate to:**
- Use recognized tax software
- Consult an accountant or specialist
- Get help from a knowledgeable family member

### Keep Your Documents

**Keep for 7 years:**
- Your copy of the return
- All your tax slips
- Your supporting documents

## Important Dates to Remember

**April 30:** Deadline to file your return

**Important:** Even if you don't owe tax, it's often advantageous to file a return to:
- Receive your credits (GST, solidarity)
- Maintain your government benefits
- Keep your file up to date

## Planning for the Following Year

### Adjust Your Tax Withholdings

If you had to pay a lot of tax this year:
- Ask to increase withholdings on your pensions
- Consider making installment payments

### Plan Your RRIF Withdrawals

**Withdraw only the required minimum** if you don't need more. This:
- Reduces your taxes
- Avoids OAS clawback
- Lets your money grow tax-sheltered

### Think About Splitting

If your spouse has lower income:
- Use pension splitting
- Contribute to their TFSA rather than yours
- Plan your withdrawals accordingly

## What Changes Each Year

### New Exemption Amounts

Exemption thresholds and tax credits change every year. Check:
- The new OAS clawback threshold
- New tax credit amounts
- New tax rates

### New Rules

Tax laws can change. Stay informed:
- Check the Canada Revenue Agency website
- Read tax news
- Ask a professional for advice
