# How Much Money Do I Really Need? - Calculating Your Needs Without Breaking Your Head

"One million dollars!" That's often the first answer that comes to mind when we think about the amount needed for a comfortable retirement. But is this magic answer really suited to your situation? Spoiler: probably not.

Retirement planning isn't a universal formula. According to a Retraite Québec survey, half of Quebecers don't feel competent enough to plan their own retirement. Yet, calculating your real needs can be simpler than you think, provided you use the right tools and methods.

## Why Your Neighbor and You Don't Have the Same Needs

Before diving into calculations, you need to understand a fundamental truth: your retirement needs depend entirely on your desired lifestyle.

### Different Retirements, Different Needs

Let's take some concrete examples. Pierre dreams of spending six months a year in Florida and six months in Quebec. Marie prefers a peaceful cottage by a lake. Jean wants to play expensive sports like golf. Sophie simply wants to spend more time with family and volunteer.

These four people can have the same income today, but their financial needs in retirement will be radically different. That's why one-size-fits-all formulas often don't work.

### Personal Factors to Consider

Several elements influence your financial needs:

- **Your desired retirement age**: The earlier you leave, the more you need to save
- **Your health and family longevity**
- **Your retirement projects**: travel, leisure, residence
- **Your family situation**: spouse, dependent children
- **Your current and future income sources**

## General Rules: Useful but Imperfect

### The 60% to 80% Rule

Experts generally recommend having between 60% and 80% of your average annual gross income from the last three years of work to maintain your standard of living in retirement.

**Concrete example**: If your annual income is $50,000 at the end of your career, you would need $30,000 to $40,000 per year in retirement.

This rule assumes that in retirement, certain expenses naturally decrease:
- Contributions to QPP, employment insurance and other payroll deductions
- Transportation costs to go to work
- Professional clothing
- Retirement savings itself
- Family charges (paid mortgage, independent children)

But beware, other expenses increase:
- Healthcare
- Social and recreational activities
- Potentially travel expenses

### Why This Rule Has Its Limits

The 60% to 80% rule doesn't always apply. Here's why:

**If you're a good saver**: A person who earns $100,000 but spends only $40,000 certainly won't need $70,000 per year in retirement.

**If you're a spender**: Conversely, someone who spends $80,000 on an income of $100,000 will need more than $70,000 to maintain their standard of living.

**If your income is modest**: Small incomes often need more than 80% to cover essential needs.

## The 4% Rule: Calculate According to Your Real Expenses

### The Basic Principle

The 4% rule is considered more accurate because it's based on your real expenses rather than your income. The principle: you can withdraw 4% of your investments annually without risking depleting your capital.

This rule, developed by financial advisor William Bengen in 1994, has been tested on 50 years of historical financial market data. Even during the economic crises of the 1930s and 1970s, a 4% withdrawal rate never depleted a portfolio in less than 33 years.

### How to Apply It

The formula is simple: you need to accumulate 25 times your annual expenses in investments.

**Practical examples**:
- Annual expenses of $30,000 → Required portfolio: $750,000 ($30,000 × 25)
- Annual expenses of $40,000 → Required portfolio: $1,000,000 ($40,000 × 25)
- Annual expenses of $20,000 → Required portfolio: $500,000 ($20,000 × 25)

### Important Nuances

This rule works well but has its limits:
- It includes inflation adjustment
- It's better suited for 30-35 year retirements
- For very early retirements (before 40), use 3.25% instead (30 times expenses)
- It assumes a balanced portfolio between stocks and bonds

## Concrete Examples That Speak

### Xavier's Case, 35 Years Old

Xavier dreams of retiring at 60 to dedicate himself to sailing. With a target income of $35,000 per year:

**Retirement at 60 scenario**:
- Required savings: $11,000 per year
- Sources: Reduced QPP + personal RRSP

**Retirement at 65 scenario**:
- Required savings: $4,300 per year
- Sources: Full QPP + OAS + personal RRSP

The difference is striking: delaying retirement by five years divides the necessary savings effort by more than two.

### Audrey's Case, 28 Years Old

Audrey earns $45,000 per year and applies the 10% net income rule for retirement savings. By saving about $3,000 annually with a 3.9% return, she would accumulate more than $310,000 in 35 years of career.

## Practical Tools to Calculate Your Needs

### Budget: The Foundation of Everything

Before any calculation, you need to know your current income and expenses. How many people are unable to indicate where their money goes? Making a budget provides an overview and reveals the margin needed for retirement savings.

**Essential steps**:
1. List all your fixed expenses (rent, electricity, debt repayment)
2. Calculate your variable expenses (food, clothing, leisure)
3. Identify expenses that will change in retirement
4. Determine your possible savings margin

### Simulators at Your Disposal

#### SimulR from Retraite Québec
This free and user-friendly tool is for everyone, regardless of your financial knowledge. It estimates your future income from QPP, OAS, RRSPs and employer plans. More importantly, it tells you the additional amounts to save each year to reach your goals.

**Available at**: educepargne.ca and retraitequebec.gouv.qc.ca

#### SimulRetraite (via clicSÉQUR)
For more personalized and detailed estimates, this tool requires a clicSÉQUR account but offers precise projections of all your income sources.

#### Specialized Calculators
Other tools exist according to your needs:
- FIRE or CoastFIRE calculators for early retirements
- Quebec simulators including OAS and QPP
- Personalized financial planning tools

### How to Use These Tools Effectively

**Test different scenarios**:
- Retirement at 60 vs 65
- Impact of additional savings
- Effect of delaying government benefits

**Review regularly**: Your situation evolves, so do your projections. Redo the calculation each year or during major changes.

**Be realistic**: Tools give estimates. Plan for a safety margin.

## The 10% Rule: Your Starting Point

If all these calculations seem complex, start with the simple rule of 10% of your net income dedicated to retirement savings. This basic rule gives a general estimate to maintain your standard of living in retirement.

**Example**: Audrey, with her $45,000 salary, dedicates about $3,000 per year (10% of her net income after taxes) to her retirement savings. She diversifies between RRSP and labor-sponsored funds to maximize tax advantages.

This rule depends however on:
- When you start saving
- The return on your investments
- Your specific retirement goals

## Special Considerations

### Women Face Particular Challenges

Women's retirement income is often lower than men's. Maternity leaves and career interruptions reduce contributions to retirement plans. Moreover, women live longer on average, which increases their savings needs.

### The Impact of Starting Age

The earlier you start saving, the more comfortable your situation will be:
- **20 years before retirement**: $30 per month to accumulate $12,000
- **10 years before retirement**: $85 per month for the same amount
- **5 years before retirement**: $200 per month

The magic of compound interest makes all the difference.

### Part-time Work in Retirement

If you plan to work part-time in retirement, your savings needs decrease. This supplementary income can cover part of your expenses and reduce the amount to withdraw from your investments.

## How to Pay Yourself First

The secret of good savers: "pay yourself first". Before paying all your other expenses, automatically transfer your retirement savings. This method forces you to adjust your expenses according to your real means.

**Practical strategies**:
- Automatic transfers on payday
- Progressive increase in savings (1% per year)
- Using tax refunds to boost savings

## Adapt Your Strategy According to Your Profile

### The Conservative Profile
If you prefer security, aim for the high end of the range (80% of income) and start saving earlier. Favor guaranteed investments even if they offer more modest returns.

### The Optimistic Profile
If you accept more risk and count on higher returns, you can aim for 60% to 70% of your current income. But beware of market surprises.

### The Flexible Profile
Prepare for different scenarios. Maybe you'll have to work a bit longer or adjust your lifestyle. Flexibility is often the key to successful retirement.

## The Importance of Regular Review

Your needs evolve. A divorce, inheritance, health problem or change in projects can completely modify your calculations. Review your projections:
- Annually during tax filing
- During major situation changes
- As retirement approaches to fine-tune details

## Resources to Accompany You

### Professionals to Consult
- **Financial planners**: for a comprehensive personalized strategy
- **Investment advisors**: to optimize your investments
- **Accountants**: for tax optimization

### Courses and Training
The Union des consommateurs offers budget courses through ACEFs. It's an excellent starting point to master your personal finances.

### Government Support

## Conclusion: Start Where You Are

Calculating your retirement needs doesn't have to be an insurmountable puzzle. The important thing is to start somewhere, even with rough estimates.

**Your next steps**:
1. **Establish your current budget** to know your real expenses
2. **Use SimulR** to get a first estimate
3. **Apply the 10% rule** as a starting point for your savings
4. **Test different scenarios** according to your retirement projects
5. **Consult a professional** for a personalized strategy

Remember that retirement planning is a marathon, not a sprint. Every dollar saved today brings you closer to your goals. And even if you don't exactly reach your initial targets, you'll be in a much better position than if you had done nothing.

As experts say: "The best time to start was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
