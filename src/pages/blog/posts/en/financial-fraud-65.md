# How to Avoid Financial Fraud After Age 65

## Why Are People 65+ Targeted?

When you retire, you unfortunately become an easier target for fraudsters. They think you have money saved up, that you're more alone, and sometimes less familiar with new technologies. This is false, of course, but it's what they believe.

## Fraudsters Know Things About You

### Your Income Is Predictable

Fraudsters know you probably receive:
- Your Quebec Pension Plan (QPP) pension
- Your Old Age Security pension
- Maybe a pension from your former employer
- Withdrawals from your RRSPs or RRIFs

This income arrives on fixed dates. Fraudsters know this and adjust their approaches accordingly.

### You Might Be More Isolated

After retirement, your network of work friends disappears. You might have more free time and be more alone. Fraudsters count on this to make you talk longer on the phone.

## Most Common Types of Fraud

### 1. Phone Calls

**The Grandparent Scam**
- Someone calls pretending to be your grandchild
- The person says they're in trouble and need money right away
- They ask you not to call the parents
- They want you to send money by transfer or gift card

**The Fake Government Official Scam**
- Someone pretends to be an employee of Revenue Quebec or the government
- They say you owe money in taxes
- They threaten to arrest you if you don't pay immediately
- They ask for payment by gift card or transfer

**The Lottery or Prize Scam**
- You're told you've won a large amount
- To collect your prize, you must pay fees upfront
- You'll never win anything

### 2. Suspicious Emails

**Phishing**
- You receive an email that seems to come from your bank
- The email says there's a problem with your account
- You're asked to click a link to "verify" your information
- The link leads to a fake website that steals your passwords

**Fake Bills**
- You receive a bill for a service you didn't request
- For example, antivirus for your computer
- If you call the number, they try to sell you other things

### 3. Home Visits

**Unsolicited Renovations**
- Someone rings your doorbell and says they noticed a problem with your roof
- They offer to fix it right away at a "special price"
- They ask for full payment before starting
- The work is poorly done or not done at all

**Pressure Sales**
- Salespeople who insist on entering your home
- They sell "miracle" health products or very expensive vacuum cleaners
- They don't leave until they've made a sale

### 4. Fake Financial Advisors

**"Guaranteed" Investments**
- Someone offers you an investment with impossible returns
- They say it's risk-free and guaranteed
- They ask for your money quickly
- Once they have your money, they disappear

## Warning Signs to Recognize

### On the Phone
- The person creates a sense of urgency: "You must act right now!"
- They refuse to let you hang up to think
- They ask for personal information (social insurance number, password)
- They want to be paid only by gift card, transfer, or cash

### In Emails
- The sender's address doesn't match the organization mentioned
- There are French grammar errors
- The tone is urgent or threatening
- You're asked to click on suspicious links

### In Person
- The person shows up without an appointment
- They insist on entering your home
- They pressure you to sign immediately
- They ask for full payment before starting work

## How to Protect Yourself: Good Reflexes
