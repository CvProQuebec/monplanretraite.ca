# The Smart Order for Withdrawing Your Money in Retirement

Retirement is approaching or has just begun? Now is the time to think about how to withdraw your money intelligently. After saving for years, you now need to make the right choices so your money lasts as long as possible.

## Why is the Order of Withdrawals Important?

When you withdraw your money in the right order, you can:
- Pay less taxes
- Keep more government benefits
- Make your money last longer
- Have more money for your projects

## The Recommended Order for Your Withdrawals

### 1. Start with Your TFSA

**The TFSA should be your first choice** for several important reasons:

- **No tax to pay**: Money you withdraw from your TFSA is completely tax-free
- **Your government benefits don't change**: TFSA withdrawals don't affect your Old Age Security pension or Guaranteed Income Supplement
- **You recover your contribution room**: The following year, you can put back the money you withdrew

**Practical tip**: If you don't need all the money from your RRIF, you can put the surplus back into your TFSA so it continues to grow tax-free.

### 2. Then, Non-Registered Investments

If you have money in regular (non-registered) accounts, use it second. Here's why:

- You only pay tax on the gains
- It's often less tax than with an RRSP or RRIF
- It allows you to keep your other savings longer

### 3. Your RRIF Third

Starting at age 71, you **must withdraw** a minimum amount from your RRIF each year. Here's what you need to know:

- **At 71**: you must withdraw 5.28% of your RRIF
- **At 72**: 5.40%
- **At 80**: 6.82%
- **At 90**: 11.92%

**Important tip**: You can withdraw only the mandatory minimum to let the rest grow longer.

**Trick to pay less taxes**: If your spouse is younger, you can base the minimum withdrawal calculation on their age. This will allow you to withdraw less money and pay less taxes.

### 4. Government Benefits: When to Apply?

**Old Age Security (OAS)** and **Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**:

- You can receive them from age 60 (for QPP) or 65 (for OAS)
- **But careful!** If you wait past 65, your pensions increase each month:
  - OAS: +0.6% per month of delay
  - QPP: +0.7% per month of delay

**Expert tip**: If you can afford it, wait as long as possible (until 71) to apply for your government pensions. They'll be much higher!

## Advanced Strategies to Save Money

### Split Your Income with Your Spouse

If you and your spouse don't have the same retirement income, you could save on taxes by dividing your pension income. You can transfer up to 50% of your RRIF or pension income to your spouse.

### Plan Your Large Withdrawals Over Two Years

If you need to withdraw a large sum of money, think about dividing it over two different years. This can save you a lot in taxes.

### Watch Out for Benefit Clawbacks!

If your income exceeds certain amounts, the government might reduce your benefits:
- **Old Age Security**: clawback if your income exceeds about $90,997 in 2025
- **Guaranteed Income Supplement**: for lower incomes

This is another good reason to start with the TFSA!

## Practical Tips for Good Planning

### Make Your Retirement Budget

Before deciding what to withdraw and when, calculate:
- Your basic monthly expenses (housing, food, transportation)
- Your special projects (travel, renovations)
- Your healthcare expenses

### Consolidate Your Accounts

If you have several accounts in different banks, think about grouping them. This will help you:
- Have a better overview
- Reduce your management fees
- Simplify your minimum withdrawals

### Diversify Your Investments

Even in retirement, it's important to have different types of investments to reduce risks and protect your money against inflation.

## What to Remember

**The smart order of withdrawals:**
1. **TFSA first** (no tax, keeps your benefits)
2. **Non-registered investments** (less tax)
3. **RRIF** (mandatory withdrawals from age 71)
4. **Government benefits** (waiting can be rewarding)

**Important points:**
- Start with what costs the least in taxes
- Keep your government benefits as much as possible
- Plan for the long term
- Ask for help from a financial advisor

## Need Help?

Retirement planning can seem complicated, but you're not alone. A financial planner can help you create a personalized plan according to your situation. Don't hesitate to ask for advice!

**Remember:** Every situation is different. What works for your neighbor might not be the best solution for you. The important thing is to understand your options and make informed choices to fully enjoy your retirement.
