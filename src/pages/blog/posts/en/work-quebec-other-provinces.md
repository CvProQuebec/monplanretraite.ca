# What to Do If You Worked in Quebec AND Another Province

You worked for a few years in Quebec, then moved to Ontario for your career? Or maybe you did the opposite: started in Alberta and finished in Quebec? Rest assured, your years of work in all Canadian provinces count for your retirement!

Here's everything you need to know so you don't lose any of your contributions and get all the pensions you're entitled to.

## Understanding the Two Pension Systems

In Canada, we have two government pension systems that work together:

**The Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)**: For people who work in Quebec

**The Canada Pension Plan (CPP)**: For people who work in all other provinces and territories of Canada

These two plans are like cousins: they do the same thing, but each takes care of its region. The good news? They work together to ensure you don't lose anything!

## How Does it Work When You've Worked in Both?

### Your Contributions are Automatically Combined

Imagine Pierre worked 15 years in Quebec and 20 years in Ontario. Here's what happens:

- His 15 years in Quebec are recorded in the QPP
- His 20 years in Ontario are recorded in the CPP
- **Automatically**, both systems will look at his 35 total years to calculate his pension

Pierre won't have two separate pensions. He'll have one pension that takes into account his entire career in Canada.

### One Check Per Month

Even if you worked in several provinces, you'll receive one check per month. The amount will be calculated based on:
- All your years of work in Canada
- All the salaries you earned
- The age at which you apply for your pension

## Who Do You Apply to for Retirement?

It's simple: it all depends on where you live now.

### If You Live in Quebec Now
Apply to **Retraite Québec**, even if you worked elsewhere in Canada. Retraite Québec will take care of everything and communicate with the federal government for your years worked in other provinces.

### If You Live in Another Province Now
Apply to **Service Canada**, even if you worked years in Quebec. Service Canada will take care of everything and communicate with Retraite Québec for your Quebec years.

### If You Live Outside Canada
Address your application to the province where you last lived before leaving the country.

## How to Check All Your Contributions?

### Check Your Statement of Participation

If you live in Quebec, log into the Retraite Québec website in the "My File" section. You'll see:
- Your contributions in Quebec
- **AND** your contributions in other provinces

Everything appears on the same document! If you don't see certain years, it's possible that Retraite Québec hasn't received all the data yet. Information from recent years can take time to arrive.

## Concrete Example: Marie's Story

Marie is 62 and has questions about her retirement. Here's her journey:

**1980 to 1995**: She works in Montreal as a nurse (15 years in Quebec)
**1995 to 2010**: She moves to Toronto for a new position (15 years in Ontario)
**2010 to 2023**: She returns to finish her career in Quebec (13 years in Quebec)

**Total:** 43 years of work in Canada

**What she must do:**
1. Since she now lives in Quebec, she applies to Retraite Québec
2. Her pension will be calculated on her complete 43 years
3. She'll receive one check per month that takes into account her entire career

**Result:** Marie doesn't lose any years of contributions!

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Will I lose years if I worked in several provinces?"
**No!** All your years of work in Canada count, no matter where you worked.

### "Do I have to make two separate applications?"
**No!** One application is enough. The administration takes care of communicating with the other plan.

### "Will my pension be lower?"
**No!** Your pension will be calculated exactly as if you had always worked in one province. All your contributions count.

### "What happens if I don't remember all my years of work?"
No problem! The governments have kept your records. When you apply, they'll automatically find all your contributions.

## Important Details to Watch

### Your Social Insurance Number
Make sure you've always used the same social insurance number everywhere you worked. That's how governments track your contributions.

### Recent Years May Be Missing
On your statement, it's normal for recent years not to appear right away. Administrations sometimes take time to exchange information.

### Request Your Documents Early
If you plan to retire soon, request your statement of participation at least 6 months in advance. This will give you time to correct any errors if there are any.

## What You Should Remember

**Good news:** The Canadian system is designed to protect you! Whether you worked in one province or ten, all your contributions count.

**One place:** Apply where you live now. The administration takes care of the rest.

**No loss:** You're not penalized for having worked in several provinces. On the contrary, it's often advantageous to have had a varied career!

**Check your data:** Consult your statement of participation to make sure all your years appear. If something's missing, contact the administration.

## Next Steps

1. **Check your statement of participation** in My File (Retraite Québec or Service Canada depending on where you live)

2. **Verify that all your years of work appear**. If something's missing, contact the relevant administration

3. **Plan when to apply for your pension**. Remember you can apply between ages 60 and 72, with bonuses if you wait past 65

4. **Apply in the right place**: Retraite Québec if you live in Quebec, Service Canada if you live elsewhere

The system is designed to make your life easier. Your years of work throughout Canada belong to you and will all count for your retirement. You worked hard all your life - make sure you receive everything that's coming to you!
