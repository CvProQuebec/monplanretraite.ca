# Maternity Leave and Retirement: How to Catch Up

## A Challenge Many Mothers Experience

Having children is one of life's most beautiful gifts. But it can also create challenges for your retirement. When you take maternity leave or reduce your work hours to care for your family, you contribute less to your retirement plans.

The result? You might end up with less money in retirement. But don't panic! There are several ways to catch up this delay and ensure a comfortable retirement despite these interruptions.

This article explains how to protect your financial future while caring for your family.

## How Leave Affects Your Retirement

### The Impact on the Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)

During your maternity leave, you don't receive salary from your employer. Even if you receive government benefits, these amounts are often lower than your usual salary. This means:

- **Fewer QPP contributions:** You contribute less, so your future pension will be smaller
- **Years with little or no income:** This can affect the calculation of your pension at 65
- **Long-term impact:** Each year with less income counts in the final calculation

**Concrete example:** If you normally earn $50,000 per year but don't work for a complete year, that's an entire year of lost contributions to your QPP.

### The Effect on Your Personal Savings

During leave:
- **Less money to save:** With reduced income, it becomes difficult to put money aside
- **No RRSP contributions:** If you're not working, you can't contribute to your RRSP
- **Loss of compound interest:** Money you don't save can't grow over time

### Impact on Employer Plans

If you have a retirement plan with your employer, maternity leave can affect:
- **Your recognized years of service:** Some plans don't count periods without salary
- **Calculation of your future pension:** Fewer years of service = smaller pension
- **Your vested rights:** In some cases, you might lose certain benefits

## Your Rights During Maternity Leave

### Protection of Your Job and Benefits

Fortunately, the law protects you during your maternity leave:

**Your employment relationship continues:** Maternity leave doesn't end your employment. You keep your position and seniority.

**Participation in the retirement plan:** In most cases, you continue to participate in your employer's retirement plan, even without salary.

**Possibility to continue contributing:** If you and your employer pay the required contributions, you can continue accumulating retirement rights.

### What the Law Says

According to Quebec laws:
- Your employer must maintain your participation in benefit plans
- You can return to your position at the end of your leave
- Your years of service continue to accumulate

## Strategies to Catch Up

### 1. Service Buyback: A Valuable Option

If you have an employer retirement plan, you might be able to "buy back" maternity leave periods.

**How it works:**
- You pay a sum so your leave years count in your plan
- Your missed contributions are calculated with interest
- Your retirement pension will be higher

**The advantages:**
- Increases your future retirement pension
- Can allow you to retire earlier
- Amounts paid are tax-deductible
- Protects your beneficiaries in case of death

**Points to check:**
- You must still work for the company
- Not all plans allow buyback
- The cost can be high depending on years to buy back
- You need to evaluate if it's profitable in your case

**Practical tip:** Ask for an evaluation from your employer. Sometimes, the employer can pay part of the buyback!

### 2. Maximize Your Savings After Returning to Work

**Use your tax refunds:** When you return to work, you might receive interesting tax refunds. Put them directly into your RRSP.

**Gradually increase your contributions:** Start by saving small amounts and increase progressively. Even $25 per month is better than nothing.

**Catch up on unused RRSP rights:** Years when you didn't contribute, your rights accumulate. You can use them later when your income goes back up.

### 3. The TFSA: Your Best Friend During Leave

The Tax-Free Savings Account can be very useful during and after maternity leave:

**During leave:**
- No need for employment income to contribute
- Your spouse can give you money to contribute
- Withdrawals are tax-free
- Your contribution rights accumulate even if you're not working

**After leave:**
- Continue saving in your TFSA
- When your income increases, transfer money to an RRSP if it's more advantageous
- Keep money easily accessible for family emergencies

**Concrete example:** Marie couldn't contribute to her TFSA during her leave. Upon her return, she has 3 years of accumulated rights (or $21,000 in rights). She can now catch up by putting more money aside.

## Strategies by Life Stage

### Before Leave: Preparing

**3-6 months before:**
- Meet with your human resources advisor
- Learn about your retirement plan and buyback options
- Start saving more to create a financial cushion
- Maximize your RRSP contributions before income stops

**Plan your leave budget:**
- Calculate your government benefits
- Evaluate how much you can save during leave
- Discuss with your spouse about financial distribution

### During Leave: Staying on Track

**Continue saving, even little:**
- Put aside even just $20 per month
- Use your TFSA to keep flexibility
- Stay in touch with your investments and retirement plan

**Stay informed:**
- Follow the evolution of your retirement rights
- Request annual statements from your employer
- Already plan your return strategy

### Upon Return: Actively Catching Up

**The first 12 months:**
- Evaluate the service buyback option with a professional
- Gradually increase your RRSP contributions
- Use your RRSP rights accumulated during leave

**Long-term strategy:**
- Work a few more years if necessary
- Maximize your last years of high contribution
- Consider part-time work in pre-retirement

## How to Evaluate if Buyback is Worth It

### Questions to Ask Yourself

1. **How much does it cost?** Ask for a precise quote from your employer
2. **How much does it earn?** Calculate the increase in your future pension
3. **Can you afford it?** Evaluate your current budget
4. **Does your employer pay part?** Some employers contribute to buyback
5. **Do you have other priorities?** Sometimes it's better to pay off debts first

### Simple Calculation Example

**Situation:** Sophie wants to buy back 1 year of maternity leave in her retirement plan.

- **Buyback cost:** $8,000
- **Increase in her pension:** $100 per month for life ($1,200 per year)
- **Recovery time:** $8,000 รท $1,200 = 6.7 years

If Sophie retires at 60 and lives to 85, she'll receive this extra for 25 years. Total received: $30,000. It's a good investment!

### Consult Professionals

- **Financial planner:** To evaluate your overall situation
- **Tax specialist:** To understand impacts on your taxes
- **Your plan administrator:** For precise buyback calculations

## Other Strategies to Catch Up

### Working a Few More Years

If you've taken several leaves or reduced your hours, consider:
- Delaying your retirement by 2-3 years
- Working part-time during your pre-retirement
- Maximizing your contributions in your last working years

**The advantage:** Your last working years are often when you earn the most. It's the ideal time to catch up!

### Optimizing as a Couple

If you have a spouse:
- **Share savings:** The one who earns more can save more
- **Plan together:** Coordinate your RRSP and TFSA strategies
- **Income splitting:** In retirement, you might be able to share certain income to pay less tax

### Additional Income

**During leave:**
- Part-time or occasional work
- Self-employment from home
- Selling products or services

**After return:**
- Overtime when possible
- Training to get a promotion
- Side projects to increase your income

## Mistakes to Avoid

### Don't Get Discouraged

**Common mistake:** "I took leave, my retirement is ruined."
**Reality:** It's always possible to catch up, even partially.

### Waiting Too Long

**Common mistake:** "I'll deal with it later."
**Reality:** The longer you wait, the harder and more expensive it is to catch up.

### Not Asking for Help

**Common mistake:** Trying to understand everything alone.
**Reality:** Professionals can save you a lot of money and stress.

### Neglecting the TFSA

**Common mistake:** Focusing only on the RRSP.
**Reality:** The TFSA is often more flexible for families.

## Available Assistance Programs

### Government Assistance

**Guaranteed Income Supplement:** If your retirement income is low, you might be entitled to this assistance.

**Spousal Allowance:** If your spouse receives Old Age Security pension, you might also receive assistance.

**Tax Credits:** Several credits can help you during years of lower income.

### Employer Programs

- Some employers have assistance programs for service buyback
- Employer-matched savings plans
- Training programs to facilitate return to work

## Inspiring Examples of Mothers Who Succeeded
