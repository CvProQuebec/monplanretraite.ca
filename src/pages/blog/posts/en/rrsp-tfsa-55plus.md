# RRSP vs TFSA: Which to Choose at 55 and Over?

You're 55 and wondering where to put your money to properly prepare for retirement? Between the RRSP and TFSA, the choice can seem complicated. Yet, when you understand how each works, the decision becomes clearer.

Here's everything you need to know to make the right choice according to your situation.

## Quick Reminder: What are RRSPs and TFSAs?

### RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan)
- **Main advantage:** You save on taxes now
- **Disadvantage:** You pay tax when you withdraw the money
- **Age limit:** You must convert it to a RRIF at 71
- **Withdrawals:** Difficult before retirement (tax penalties)

### TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account)
- **Main advantage:** No tax to pay on withdrawals
- **Disadvantage:** No tax deduction when you contribute
- **Age limit:** No limit, you can contribute your whole life
- **Withdrawals:** Free at any time, without penalty

## Why at 55, the Strategy Changes

At 55 and over, you're in a particular situation:
- You have about 10-15 years left before retirement
- You're probably earning your best salary
- You're starting to think concretely about your retirement
- Your flexibility needs are increasing

This stage of your life changes the rules of the game for choosing between RRSP and TFSA.

## The Big RRSP Trap After 55

### The Problem of Mandatory Minimum Withdrawal

Here's something many people don't know: **At 72, you MUST start withdrawing money from your RRIF** (the former RRSP), whether you need it or not!

**Concrete example:**
If you have $300,000 in your RRIF at 72, you must withdraw at minimum:
- **At 72:** $16,200 per year
- **At 80:** $20,460 per year
- **At 90:** $35,760 per year

**The problem:** These withdrawals are added to your other income and can:
- Make you pay more tax
- **Make you lose part of your Old Age Security** if your income exceeds $90,997

### An Example That Makes You Think

Marie is 58 and earns $80,000 per year. She's hesitating between putting $10,000 in her RRSP or TFSA.

**If she chooses the RRSP:**
- She saves about $3,600 in taxes this year
- But at 72, she'll have to withdraw this money and pay tax
- If her income is too high, she might lose OAS

**If she chooses the TFSA:**
- No tax savings now
- But in retirement, she can withdraw her money tax-free
- Her withdrawals don't affect her OAS or other benefits

## The Advantages of TFSA After 55

### 1. Total Flexibility
From age 55, unexpected events can happen:
- Health problems
- Need to help children or grandchildren
- Desire for travel or special projects
- Unplanned early retirement

With the TFSA, you can withdraw your money anytime, without tax penalty.

### 2. No Mandatory Minimum Withdrawal
Unlike RRSP/RRIF, **you're never forced to withdraw money from your TFSA**. You keep total control.

### 3. Protection of Government Benefits
TFSA withdrawals don't count as income. This means they don't affect:
- Your Old Age Security pension
- Your Guaranteed Income Supplement
- Your age-related tax credits

### 4. More Advantageous Inheritance
At your death, your spouse can inherit your TFSA tax-free, unlike the RRSP.

## When to Choose RRSP After 55?

The RRSP can still be advantageous if:

### 1. You Have a Very High Income Now
If you earn more than $100,000 per year, the immediate tax savings from the RRSP can be very interesting.

### 2. You Expect Much Lower Income in Retirement
If you think your tax rate will be much lower in retirement than today.

### 3. You Have a Generous Pension Fund
If you already have a good pension from your employer, you might need less flexibility.

## The Winning Strategy: Both!

In most cases, **the best strategy after 55 is to diversify**:

### Step 1: Maximize Your TFSA First
Contribute the maximum allowed in your TFSA each year ($7,000 in 2025).

### Step 2: Use RRSP for the Rest
If you have money left to save, put it in your RRSP for the tax savings.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Withdrawal
Around 65-70, start withdrawing from your RRSP to transfer it to your TFSA (if you have available contribution room).

## Concrete Example: Robert, 57 Years Old

Robert earns $75,000 per year and can save $15,000 per year.

**His strategy:**
1. **$7,000 in TFSA** (maximum allowed)
2. **$8,000 in RRSP** (for tax savings)

**Result at 67:**
- **TFSA:** $100,000 available tax-free, with total flexibility
- **RRSP:** $115,000 that will give him regular retirement income

Robert has the best of both worlds: flexibility AND retirement income!

## Mistakes to Avoid After 55

### ❌ Mistake 1: Putting Everything in RRSP
You might end up with mandatory withdrawals that are too high and lose government benefits.

### ❌ Mistake 2: Ignoring the TFSA
You lose a golden opportunity to have tax-free and flexible money.

### ❌ Mistake 3: Not Planning Withdrawal
Waiting until 71 to think about your withdrawal strategy is too late.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "I already have a lot in my RRSP, what should I do?"
Start maximizing your TFSA now. Around 65-67, you can withdraw small amounts from your RRSP to transfer them to your TFSA.

### "My advisor tells me to continue with RRSP, who's right?"
Your advisor knows your complete situation. But make sure they consider the impact of mandatory RRIF withdrawals and protection of your government benefits.

### "Can I have both?"
Absolutely! It's even often the best strategy. Maximize your TFSA first, then use the RRSP.

## What to Remember

**At 55 and over, the TFSA often becomes more advantageous than the RRSP because:**

✅ **Total flexibility** - Withdraw when you want, without penalty
✅ **No mandatory withdrawal** - You keep control
✅ **Benefit protection** - Doesn't affect your OAS or credits
✅ **Advantageous inheritance** - Tax-free transmission to spouse
✅ **Simplicity** - Fewer complex rules to manage

**The winning strategy: diversify!**
1. Maximize your TFSA first ($7,000 in 2025)
2. Use RRSP for the rest of your savings
3. Plan your withdrawal now

## Next Steps

1. **Calculate your TFSA contribution rights** - Check on the Canada Revenue Agency website

2. **Evaluate your tax situation** - What will your tax rate be in retirement?

3. **Consult a financial planner** - For a personalized strategy that considers your entire situation

4. **Start now** - The longer you wait, the less time you have to optimize your retirement

Remember: there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Your personal situation, your current and future income, and your retirement goals influence the best choice for you.

The important thing is to start saving and make informed choices. Your future self will thank you!
