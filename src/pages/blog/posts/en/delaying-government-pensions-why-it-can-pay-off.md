# Delaying Government Pensions: Why It Can Pay Off

Waiting to start your government pensions (QPP/CPP and OAS) can be one of the best decisions you make for retirement — especially if you’re healthy and have other income to cover your needs.

This article explains the main reasons to delay, when it makes sense, and when it doesn’t.

## Quick recap: what increases with a delay?

- QPP/CPP (age 60–72):
  - Early: −0.6% per month before 65 (−36% at 60)
  - Late: +0.7% per month after 65 (+42% at 70, +58.8% at 72)
- OAS (age 65–70):
  - +0.6% per month after 65 (+36% at 70)

These increases are permanent and indexed by inflation. In other words, your bigger pension stays bigger for life.

## 5 reasons delaying can pay off

1) Bigger, inflation‑protected lifetime income  
- Government pensions are indexed. A larger base protects your future buying power — even if markets disappoint.

2) Longevity insurance (you won’t “outlive” it)  
- If you live longer than average, you collect more total dollars by waiting because of the permanent bonus.

3) Better tax planning in your 60s  
- You can draw more from RRSP/RRIF or non‑registered accounts earlier (at lower tax brackets) while you wait, then rely more on bigger indexed pensions later. This often reduces lifetime taxes.

4) OAS clawback protection  
- A larger OAS starting at 70 can be okay if your other taxable income later is lower. Meanwhile, drawing RRSPs earlier can help you avoid future clawbacks by shrinking your registered balance.

5) Survivor protection for couples  
- The survivor often lives on one set of pensions and may face higher taxes as a single filer. A higher QPP/CPP for the higher‑earner can improve the survivor’s long‑term security.

## When delaying makes less sense

- You need the money now to pay bills
- Poor health or significantly reduced life expectancy
- No other sources of income to bridge the gap
- You plan to increase spending heavily in your early 60s and don’t want to draw down savings

## Break‑even intuition (simple view)

- Between 60 and 65 (QPP/CPP): break‑even often around 9–12 years after 65
- Between 65 and 70: break‑even often around 12–15 years after 65

If your health and family history suggest you’ll likely live into your 80s, waiting frequently wins.

## A practical “delay” strategy

1) Cover your 60–70 needs with:
- Work income (part‑time), and/or
- RRSP/RRIF withdrawals, and/or
- Non‑registered savings (more tax‑flexible), and
- TFSA if needed (no tax on withdrawals)

2) Start pensions later:
- QPP/CPP often at 70–72 (max bonus)
- OAS at 70 (36% bonus)

3) Rebalance taxes:
- Use lower tax brackets in your 60s
- Reduce future RRIF minimums and OAS clawback exposure

## Example (simple numbers)

- At 65, a full QPP/CPP could be about $1,433/month
- At 70, delaying increases it to ~$2,035/month (+42%)
- Over a long retirement (e.g., into your late 80s/90s), the extra, inflation‑protected income often more than repays the years you waited

## Couple coordination tips

- If one spouse is in poor health and the other is healthy, consider:
  - Sick spouse starts earlier
  - Healthy spouse delays to 70–72
- Consider income splitting and the survivor’s long‑term taxes and benefits

## Decision checklist

- Health and family longevity
- Ability to fund 60–70 from savings/part‑time work
- Current and future tax brackets
- OAS clawback risk
- Survivor protection needs

## Bottom line

Delaying QPP/CPP and OAS isn’t for everyone — but for healthy retirees with some savings, it’s often a powerful way to:
- Increase guaranteed, inflation‑indexed income
- Lower lifetime taxes
- Reduce the risk of running out of money at advanced ages

Run the numbers for your situation. A small change in timing can add up to tens of thousands of dollars over your retirement.

For a personalized view, build a simple cash‑flow plan: estimate spending, test different pension start ages, and consider the tax mix of your withdrawals. A higher, inflation‑protected income later can be the best insurance you buy — and it’s built into the system.
