# Retirement and Separation: Protecting Your Rights

## A Difficult Time That Requires Important Decisions

When a couple separates, it's a very difficult time. In addition to grief, important decisions must be made about money and retirement. These choices will affect your financial future. It's important to understand your rights well so you don't lose money.

In Quebec, the rules aren't the same for all couples. It depends on whether you're married, in a civil union, or common-law partners. Each situation has its own rules. That's why you need to be well informed.

## Rules According to Your Couple Situation

### For Married Spouses or Civil Union Partners

If you're married or in a civil union, you have important protections. Since 1989, Quebec has rules about the family patrimony. These rules protect both spouses when there's a separation.

**What's included in the family patrimony:**
- The family home
- Household furniture
- Cars used by the family
- Money saved for retirement during the marriage

To officially separate, you usually need a court judgment. In some cases, civil union partners can make a declaration with a notary if they agree and don't have children together.

### For Common-Law Partners

Common-law partners don't have the same protections. Family patrimony rules don't apply to them. This means they don't automatically owe each other anything upon separation.

But be careful! This doesn't mean there can't be sharing. Common-law partners can:
- Make a cohabitation agreement before living together
- Decide together to share certain assets
- Request sharing of certain retirement savings

There's no need for a judgment for common-law partners to officially separate.

## Your Retirement Savings: What Can Be Shared

### The Quebec Pension Plan (QPP)

QPP sharing is done on work income earned during your life as a couple. These incomes are added together and shared equally.

**For married or civil union couples:**
- Sharing is done automatically
- You can renounce it if you want
- You must apply within the right timeframes

**For common-law partners:**
- Both ex-partners must request it
- You must wait 12 months after separation
- The request must be made within 3 years

**Important points to remember:**
- Sharing can help the one who contributed less
- The one who contributed more might see their pension decrease
- You must request a simulation before deciding

### Employer Retirement Plans

If you have a retirement plan with your employer, it can also be shared. But the rules change according to the type of plan and your situation.

**For Quebec private sector:**
- All ex-spouses can request sharing
- This includes married, civil union and common-law couples

**For Quebec public sector:**
- Only couples subject to family patrimony
- Common-law partners can agree in writing within 12 months

**Important:** You cannot lose more than 50% of your retirement rights due to sharing.

### RRSPs, RRIFs and Other Savings

These personal savings can also be shared, but rules vary according to your situation. You need to look at:
- What type of savings you have
- If it's in the family patrimony
- The laws that apply to your case

## How to Protect Your Rights

### Before Making Important Decisions

**Request a simulation:** Before renouncing or accepting sharing, ask Retraite Québec to calculate the effects on your future pension. It's free and helps you make the right decision.

**Consult an expert:** A legal advisor, financial planner, or notary can explain your rights according to your situation.

**Keep your papers:** Keep all important documents: retirement statements, contracts, judgments.

### Mistakes to Avoid

**Not acting quickly enough:** There are deadlines for requesting sharing. If you wait too long, you might lose your rights.

**Renouncing without understanding:** Never renounce sharing without knowing what it will cost you.

**Forgetting certain savings:** Think about all your types of savings: RRSPs, employer plans, insurance.

### Acting at the Right Time

It's not necessary to wait for your retirement to do the sharing. It's even better to do it quickly after separation. This avoids complications later.

## Blended Families

If you rebuild your life with someone else, you need to think about several important things:

### New Financial Challenges

- Make a new family budget
- Decide how to use the money each person brings
- Choose the right insurance for the new family
- Plan money for emergencies

### Legal Documents to Update

**Wills:** Be careful with wills that say "everything to my spouse." This can deprive your children from the first marriage of their inheritance.

**Insurance:** Change your beneficiaries on your life insurance policies.

**Mandates:** Update your mandates in case of incapacity.

### Talking with Children

If you have children from a first marriage, include them in inheritance discussions. They may have already received money from a deceased parent. This must be taken into account in planning.

## Impacts on Your Taxes

A change in marital status can change your taxes in several ways:

- **Income splitting:** You might be able to pay less tax by sharing your retirement income
- **Tax credits:** Certain credits change according to your family situation
- **Government allowances:** Your eligibility for certain assistance may change

## Practical Tips for Getting Through It Well

### During Separation

1. **Take stock of all your assets:** House, savings, insurance, debts
2. **Request statements from all your retirement plans**
3. **Calculate what the separation will cost you**
4. **Plan your future financial needs**

### For Your New Life

1. **Redo your budget:** Your income and expenses have changed
2. **Adjust your retirement goals:** You might need to work longer or save more
3. **Review your investments:** Make sure they still suit your situation
4. **Plan for your health:** Medical expenses cost more as we age

## Resources to Help You

### Government Organizations

- **Retraite Québec:** For everything concerning the QPP and public plans
- **Employment and Social Development Canada:** For the Canada Pension Plan
- **Revenu Québec:** For tax questions

### Professionals to Consult

- **Financial planner:** To redo your retirement plan
- **Legal advisor:** To understand your legal rights
- **Notary:** For contracts and wills
- **Accountant:** To optimize your taxes

## In Summary: Your Essential Rights

A separation is difficult, but you have important rights regarding your retirement:

**You have the right:**
- To a share of savings accumulated during your life as a couple
- To simulations to understand the impacts
- To time to make your decisions
- To help from professionals

**You must:**
- Act within the timeframes provided by law
- Keep all your important documents
- Ask for advice before renouncing anything
- Think about your long-term financial future

**Don't forget:** Each situation is different. What's good for one person isn't necessarily good for another. That's why it's so important to be well informed and ask for advice.

Retirement is important. Even if your life changes because of a separation, you have the right to ensure a decent financial future. Take the time to understand your options well and don't hesitate to ask for help. You deserve it.
