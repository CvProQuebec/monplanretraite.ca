# Why Keep 60 to 75% in Stocks During Retirement: The Modern Planning Revolution

*Published September 18, 2025 | Reading time: 8 minutes*

**Did you think that in retirement you had to sell all your stocks to buy “safe” bonds? That old-fashioned strategy could ruin your retirement. Discover why experts now recommend keeping 60 to 75% in stocks—even at age 70.**

---

## 🚨 **The Traditional Rule That Ruins Retirements**

For decades, financial advisors preached the same rule: **“100 - your age = percentage in stocks.”**
So, at 70, you should have only 30% in stocks.

**That rule has become dangerous.** Why? Because it was created in an era when:

* Life expectancy in retirement was 15 years (vs. 30+ years today)
* Interest rates were 15–20% (vs. 2–5% today)
* Investment choices were limited

> **“The riskiest portfolio was the one with 0% stocks. If you stay 100% in cash, there’s an 81% chance that after 30 years you’ll be out of money.”**
> *– Updated analysis of the Trinity Study (William Bengen)*

## 📊 **The Shocking Data That Changes Everything**

### **Result #1: “Safe” Money Will Ruin You**

A groundbreaking study analyzing **every retirement start since 1928** produced stunning results:

* **100% cash portfolio**: 81% chance of running out of money in 30 years
* **50/50 stocks/bonds portfolio**: 10–15% chance of running out
* **75% stocks/25% bonds portfolio**: 5–8% chance of running out

**The cruel irony**: The more you try to “protect” yourself, the more you expose yourself to poverty risk.

### **Result #2: Even the Worst Crises Turn Profitable**

The study tested retirements that began during **the worst crises** in history:

* The 1929 crash and Great Depression
* The 1973–74 crisis (44% drop)
* The 2000–2002 dot-com crash
* The 2008 financial crisis

**Shocking result**: Even when retiring at the **worst possible moment**, a well-balanced portfolio with 60–75% stocks survived in 90–95% of cases.

## 💡 **Why Inflation Is Your Real Enemy**

### **The Brutal Math of Inflation**

At 3% annual inflation (Canada’s historical average):

* What costs **\$100 today** will cost **\$181 in 20 years**
* What costs **\$100 today** will cost **\$243 in 30 years**

**Concrete example**: If groceries cost you \$150 per week today, they’ll cost **\$365 per week in 30 years**.

### **Bonds Don’t Beat Inflation Long-Term**

* **Government bonds**: Average return 4–5% (2–3% after inflation)
* **Diversified stocks**: Average return 7–8% (4–5% after inflation)

**Over 30 years**, that 2–3% difference compounds into an enormous wealth gap.

## 🎯 **The Winning New Strategy: 60–75% Stocks**

### **Recommended Allocation by Age – 2025 Version**

| **Age**   | **% Stocks** | **% Bonds** | **Logic**                                  |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **60–65** | 70–75%       | 25–30%      | Transition to retirement, growth needed    |
| **65–75** | 65–70%       | 30–35%      | Active retirement, higher longevity        |
| **75–85** | 60–65%       | 35–40%      | Partial protection, growth maintained      |
| **85+**   | 55–60%       | 40–45%      | More conservative, but growth still needed |

### **The Modernized 4% Rule**

With this allocation, you can apply the **updated 4% rule**:

1. **Year 1**: Withdraw 4% of your total capital
2. **Following years**: Increase this amount by 3% (inflation)
3. **Result**: Your money lasts 30+ years in 85–90% of scenarios

**Surprising bonus**: In 50% of cases, you’ll actually **get wealthier** in retirement!

## 🌍 **Modern Diversification: Your Lifesaver**

### **Geographic: Canada Alone Isn’t Enough**

The Canadian market represents only **3% of the global economy**. Suggested allocation:

* **Canada**: 25–30% (familiarity, dividends)
* **United States**: 35–40% (largest market, innovation)
* **International**: 25–30% (Europe, Asia, emerging markets)
* **Bonds**: 25–40% depending on age

### **Sector: Mix the Cycles**

* **Technology**: Long-term growth
* **Healthcare**: Aging population
* **Financial services**: Benefit from interest rates
* **Consumer goods**: Income stability
* **Resources**: Inflation hedge

## 🛡️ **How to Manage Volatility (and Sleep at Night)**

### **Strategy #1: The Cash Ladder**

Keep **1–2 years of expenses** in cash/short-term bonds:

* **Savings account**: 6 months of expenses
* **Short-term GICs**: 6–12 months of expenses
* **1–3 year bonds**: 6–12 months of expenses

This prevents you from selling stocks during a temporary downturn.

### **Strategy #2: Automatic Rebalancing**

**Once a year**:

1. Check your current allocation
2. If it’s off by more than 5% from target, rebalance
3. Sell what went up too much, buy what went down

**Example**: Target 70/30, actual portfolio 75/25 → sell 5% stocks, buy bonds.

### **Strategy #3: Long-Term Thinking**

**Remember**:

* Since 1928, there’s **never been** a 20-year period where stocks lost money
* Every “crisis” feels terrible at the time but is just a blip on a 30-year chart
* Your biggest regret will likely be being **too conservative**, not too aggressive

## ⚠️ **The 3 Deadly Mistakes to Avoid**

### **Mistake #1: Fear of Fluctuations**

**Wrong mindset**: “I can’t stand seeing my portfolio drop 20%”
**Right mindset**: “I can’t stand running out of money at 85”

**Reality**: Over 30 years, you’ll live through 4–6 major corrections. All recover if you stay invested.

### **Mistake #2: Believing Bonds Are Safe**

**Truth**: Bonds are safe **short term**, but dangerous **long term** because of inflation.

In an inflationary environment, bonds can lose **more** than stocks over 10+ years.

### **Mistake #3: Wanting to “Keep Capital Intact”**

**Myth**: “I don’t want to touch my capital”
**Reality**: With inflation, keeping \$800,000 today = only \$330,000 in purchasing power in 30 years

**Real goal**: Preserve your **purchasing power**, not a nominal figure.

## 🔍 **FAQ**

### **Q: Isn’t 75% in stocks too risky at age 70?**

**A:** The real risk is running out of money at 90. Historical data shows 75% stocks perform **better** than 30% stocks over 30 years—even through every crisis.

### **Q: What if the market crashes just as I retire?**

**A:** That’s exactly why you keep 1–2 years of expenses in cash. You draw from that reserve while markets recover, never selling stocks at the wrong time.

### **Q: Don’t bonds protect against inflation?**

**A:** Not traditional bonds. Only **real return bonds** truly protect, but they’re limited. Quality **stocks** have historically been the best hedge against inflation.

### **Q: What if the economy changes completely?**

**A:** Even through major upheavals (world wars, depressions, tech revolutions), quality companies adapt and grow. They represent human creativity—which always finds solutions.
